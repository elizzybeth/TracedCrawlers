The existence of the Alfa-Trump link was broken on October 31st in an exclusive report by Franklin Foer of Slate.Naveed Jamali, acting on behalf, he said, of two more senior people in US intelligence, whom I have named to the FBI, told me on Nov 7th that there was a FISA warrant targeted at two Russian banks, which covered ‘any US person’ related to the money laundering offenses which the FBI was investigating related to the Trump campaign and Russia. My story reported that:I can now report that it was not only Alfa Bank whose server was communicating with the Trump server; SVB Bank was communicating with that server too, using its own dedicated server.My exclusive report on Mike Flynn’s ‘Treason Tour’ of Europe stated on April 16 that:I added: I have corrected my earlier story to clarify some of my reporting. The money-laundering was principally communicated via Alfa Bank to the Trump server, and the database replication was communicated to Alfa Bank from the Spectrum Health server.As I reported on April 1st, in my exclusive ‘Alfa Bank, Trump Tower and a Social Media Impeachment,’ these three servers were money laundering and data laundering.Tea Pain USA provided an excellent analysis of matters here.However and further to my earlier report on Mike Flynn and SCL in April, the SVB server was sending Cambridge Analytica data targeting and propaganda messages to Trump’s server, in order that they be washed with the voter registration and DNC databases that were being sent to and from Alfa Bank.General Flynn had to amend his disclosure in August to add SCL, the propaganda-creating arm of Cambridge Analytica, to his forms. The Washington Post reported:In another story on Patribotics we broke the news that Milo Yiannopolous, the alt-right provocateur, had an account with SVB Bank. He told me that:The billionaire Peter Thiel, of Facebook’s board, was an advisor to the Trump campaign, and Facebook’s collusion with Russian funders of fake news advertisements is now front and center in the Trump Russia story.Jared Kushner, who ran the Trump data operation, met with the Russian intelligence head of a parent bank to SVB, Sberbank, in Trump Tower in December.I have previously reported exclusively on this blog both that Boris Epshteyn paid hackers on behalf of the Trump campaign – via the Alfa Server-Trump Tower connection – and on behalf of Russia, and that Donald Trump used Ocean Way Capital and Hostkey as the hackers who hosted the DNC emails on Wikileaks Russian servers."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199906162815840a3ba12"},"text":"UPDATE: Sources with links to the intelligence community have now confirmed that this theory is accurate, and I am therefore upgrading this story from my theory to a factual report.Once I announced on Twitter and elsewhere that this theory was validated by sources, data scientists who had been examining the server data began to re-examine it in the light of this statement. @TeaPainUSA on Twitter, who knows his data science, collaborated with some other patriot data scientists on Twitter and off to produce this crucial report explaining how Alfa’s server laundered the data.Original:Here is my theory of how Donald Trump will be impeached, and scores of people around him jailed.It wasn’t just money laundering – it was “data laundering”.My theory is based on public reporting, to which I will link in the text. Here it is:Alfa Bank is a front for Russian intelligence. Along with Dimitry Firtash, a Russian agent of influence, it owns Cambridge Analytica, the data targeting company used by Trump’s campaign. It also owns SCL, the propaganda company responsible for what has been termed “fake news” but was actually real propaganda co-ordinated by Russian intelligence.Cambridge Analytica and SCL use Facebook data they had no right to acquire, illegally stolen by a Russian spy working at Cambridge, to build an unbeatable target database of propaganda.In the closing days of the election, the Russian state hacked into the voter rolls of the United States. Russian intelligence did this in order that they could provide this information to Alfa Bank in order to use Cambridge Analytica’s targeting, and SCL’s propaganda, in order precisely to target voters and tip them to Trump.Paul Manafort, who had always worked for and with the Trump campaign and who never left the campaign, relayed messages to Trump based on this stolen voter database information married to Cambridge Analytica and SCL targeting.Both Manafort and Trump knew that this targeting information was based on stolen voter databases. The Alfa Bank server in Trump Tower provided fresh evidence for the granting of the FISA warrant, I reported. (this is a fact). However, the warrant was broader than merely looking at the server metadata. It explicitly covered US persons caught up in the inquiry and explicitly covered the right for the FBI to read intercepts and hear tapes and other materials on US persons, related to this inquiry, already existing and provided by intelligence from a Baltic state ally, which report was Estonia. [Editor – this is a correction from my earlier wrong report of Lithuania].I believe the Alfa Bank server was sending back to Russia information on the hacked voter databases and how they could be micro-targeted.Just before the election, Manafort, who worked with Firtash and Alfa Bank, told Trump to go and campaign in Michigan. Public polling showed that Trump had no chance in Michigan.I believe, in summary:A Russian spy stole the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of AmericansFrom that data, Russia crafted propaganda messages via SCL and targeted them by Cambridge AnalyticaBoth of these were owned by Alfa Bank and Firtash, Russian agent and boss of Manafort;In order to perfect the social media targeting Russia hacked the electoral voter databases of various key American states:This information was fed back to Manafort and Cambridge Analytica / SCL via the means of the bank server in Trump Tower;Manafort and Trump used terrifyingly accurate micro-targeting obtained firstly by Facebook theft but secondly by Russia obtaining the exact demographic profiles of voters through hacks of US state databases and passing it back to Cambridge Analytica.This theory, if true, would directly connect the Russian state with the Trump campaign and mean that Trump colluded with Russian spies who were hacking America. He will be impeached for it.There is much more Trump has done, but the Russian voter database hacks —\u003e  to Cambridge Analytica —\u003e to SCL “fake news” to target the election —-\u003e with Trump’s knowledge via Manafort –  is the single most direct proof of Trump’s collusion with America’s enemies.Furthermore and as a coda,I believe, although to what Chris Steele might call a ‘low confidence’ level, that Roger Stone was communicating with Guccifer2 who hacked the DNC and Podesta, and that these releases had not worked. I believe that whoever Stone’s “go-between” to Wikileaks was, that person worked for or with Cambridge Analytica/SCL / Alfa Bank , and that person passed on the message that precise targeting and propaganda would be needed to win the election, hence the hacking of the voter databases and the messaging that went back into them.I have a pretty strong idea who this person and his backers are, and I shall be passing it to UK intelligence.Lastly, following our exclusive reporting that Wikileaks is a Russian front who, days before the DNC hack, not only bought Russian servers, but gave their SSL keys to a Russian hacker Peter Chayanov, meaning he could see – and the FSB could see – everything on the Wikileaks site, including the IP address of any foolish Americans “whistleblowing” to Wikileaks (like Chelsea Manning), meaning Putin could blackmail them, I will assume that Chayanov is Guccifer2; that he was collaborating with Stone and Manafort both directly and indirectly; and that he worked with Russian state hackers to attack US voter databases.And, to quote Jim Carrey in ‘Liar, Liar,’ “That’s the game!” Now I will list the reporting on which this theory is based. I will address “Moscow Mike Misha Flynn” and the Cambridge University spy ring in another post – I have learned the hard way that too much information just shuts people down (when they don’t have ADHD). But as a snippet, I will say that I believe Jared Kushner and Mike Flynn were both caught talking to Russian spies who worked with Sberbank, the parent company of SVB Bank – the OTHER bank that was a named target of the FISA warrant.So, if you like, Alfa Bank – which owned Cambridge Analytica and passed info to and from Russia on hacked voter databases, for electoral gain, is the SIGINT part of this theory (Signals intelligence) – and SVB Bank, which funded “startups” through Russian intel front Sberbank, is the HUMINT part of this theory – think Kushner, Mike Flynn and Epshteyn.Again, Alfa Bank and SVB Bank are the two NAMED TARGETS of the FISA warrant granted on October 15th – one week after US intelligence put out a statement on voter database hacking, on October 7th.I believe this is why.  There was money laundering from these banks – but there was data laundering, too.Reports:FISA warrant granted on these banks (me, HeatStreet, Nov 7th 2016).FISA warrant granted on these banks October 15th – Paul Wood, BBCUS IC is correlating the voter database hack to targeting, with collusion – Paul Wood, BBCAlfa Bank and Firtash, who hired Manafort, actually own SCL and Cambridge Analytica – Ann Marlowe, the TabletThere is a secret server belonging to Alfa Bank passing information back to Russia – Franklin Foer, Slate and David Corn, Mother JonesAlex Kogan of GSR, later SCL, illegally scraped, without permission, the data of millions of Facebook users – the GuardianKogan fled to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre – MotherboardGeneral Flynn was in touch with a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University – the Financial TimesDimitry Firtash donated to Cambridge University  – Ann Marlowe, the TabletVoter databases were hacked by Russia – US IntelligenceWikileaks and Gruccifer2 are Russian fronts – US intelligenceWikileaks bought Russian servers in advance of the release of the DNC hacks – Laurelai Bailey, for PatriboticsWikileaks handed its SSL keys to Putin’s Hacker Pytor Chayonov – me, for Patribotics"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199906162815840a3ba13"},"text":"With the welter of news today from Britain’s Channel Four News and the New York Times and Guardian, it may seem that there can be nothing more to report. But the mainstream media’s welcome refocus on this firm has still not cracked the single most important part of this story: the coordination between the Trump Campaign’s data team and Russian intelligence, which used targeting data from Cambridge Analytica.We believe that the next shoe to drop in mainstream reporting – we cannot, however, say when –  will be Cambridge Analytica’s ties to Russian intelligence via Steve Bannon, Mike Flynn and the FISA warrant subject servers tied to the Trump Campaign. Here’s why.Nov 7th 2016: I report a FISA warrant targeted on two Russian banks, Alfa Bank and SVB Bank, which had a Memorandum of Understanding with Sberbank, and their communications with the Trump Organization.Nov 26, 2016: I reported for Heat Street that Steve Bannon was standing to profit from his Cambridge Analytica Board seat and – pathetically – I asked for Peter Thiel and Facebook to stop this (!) . It was just after the election, and at Heat Street we didn’t know that Facebook and Thiel were complicit. The piece asked Peter Thiel, with his transition role, to stop Steve Bannon profiting with Cambridge Analytica.In April 2017 we reported, now here at Patribotics – in a rather garbled passage –  that Cambridge Analytica targeting data and the Russian state’s propaganda makers were working together.The voter registration databases were being “washed”, I reported, with Russian intelligence created memes and Cambridge Analytica targeting dataMy main piece summarizing “a social media impeachment” put it rather more clearly:After that, I reported on “Mike Flynn’s Treason Tour” arguing that General Mike Flynn had “coordinated” Cambridge Analytica- data driven propaganda for Russia and Trump across Europe; Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Assad in Syria, and pro-Putin messaging around the world. My reporting was not that Mike Flynn physically traveled but that he supervised Europe-wide propaganda:…..In that April 16th, 2017 piece I also fingered Alex Kogan and Dimitry Firtash, under a red warrant by the FBI, for starting the operation at Cambridge University that would become Cambridge Analytica. And I called Alex Kogan “probably” a Russian spy:“Scot Sedition” August 4th, 2017, the result of crowdsourced journalism by Team Patriot, broke the news that GCHQ, the UK’s version of the NSA, had taped Donald Trump and his team in Trump Turnberry, Scotland, the weekend after Brexit, fueled by Cambridge Analytica, points out that Mike Flynn had amended his FARA to say he worked for SCL (Cambridge Analytica’s propaganda arm) and that Dan Scavino was helping Mike Flynn liase with Russian intelligence. I say “confirmed” as when I published my piece on Flynn, he had not in fact declared he was working with SCL/Cambridge Analytica.Our report saying Flynn coordinated Trump and Russia propaganda was April 2017; Flynn amended his FARA to include SCL in August 2017.Finally we reported that SVB Bank – named in the FISA warrant on Oct 15th – which signed a memorandum of understanding with Sberbank, and is linked to VEB Bank – had passed Cambridge Analytica targeting data to Trump/Russia. We also reported that Cambridge Analytica’s targeting partners, Campaign Solutions, and the Mercers “Great America PAC”, had been targeted by the FBISo what is “next” in Cambridge Analytica reporting is – we hope – an examination of how the Mercers and Steve Bannon worked with them and Russian intelligence to create and target memes for Donald Trump’s campaign. More original reporting on this is coming  shortly.With the welter of reports on Cambridge Analytica over the weekend, there has been a perception that the issue is “new” – particularly the issue of how Facebook and Cambridge Analytica partnered on the theft of Americans and Britons’ Facebook data.This story was, however, not at all new. For those who have been following Trump Russia from the start, Cambridge Analytica was reported on while the 2016 election was happening and throughout 2017.The key piece of investigative journalism was that of Harry Fox Davies, three years ago. Davies reported almost every element of this weekend’s stories back then, including:Cambridge Analytica scraped Facebook data illegally using a research quizThey stole data from those who took the quiz and from their friends who did not Facebook said in 2015 that they were “investigating” this.Mr. Davies reported:The new element in this weekend’s Guardian story  is the testimony of a whistleblower, who will now come before the Commons Select Committee next week. That committee will very likely want to ask Facebook – who have announced an “investigation” after the Guardian story – what happened to the “investigation” they promised after the first Guardian report three years ago:The Guardian piece of the weekend restates Harry Davies work, but neither mentions the original reporter, nor links to his piece. The Guardian’s splash “The Cambridge Analytica Files” starts out with two articles from March 2017. Those are the earliest pieces to which the paper gives credit. Mr. Davies expose of the Facebook data breach by Cambridge Analytica was published in December, 2015."}

From that report:Mr. Nunes still retains a security clearance, sources say. But he has been denied access to the most sensitive intelligence information. This is an extraordinary situation for a member of the House Intelligence Select Committee and reflects appallingly on Paul Ryan and on the House Oversight Committee, respectively the elected official and the Republican-led Committee responsible for ensuring the integrity of Congress.In a later story we also reported exclusively that sources with links to the intelligence community said that Boris Epshteyn paid hackers from the Kelhios botnet on behalf of both the FSB, of which, these sources say, he is an agent, and Donald Trump. We will expand on this reporting later today. Mr. Epshteyn has emphatically denied he is an FSB agent. He has refused to answer our questions as to whether he is a registered agent of influence of the Russian state under FARA. Our report has been updated to reflect Mr. Epshteyn’s denials. Nevertheless, we continue to report what we have been told on the matter by sources with links to the intelligence community.*correction – Mr. Nunes formerly led the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia inquiry.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199906162815840a3ba15"},"text":"Is Devin Nunes directly on an FBI intercept with Carter Page, receiving instructions for the Trump Transition team directly from Moscow? I believe he must be. Here’s the evidence.In December of 2016, Carter Page went back to Russia. Trump had won the election, and Devin Nunes, along with Boris Epshteyn, was part of the Transition Team, headed by Vice-President Mike Pence.Officially, Carter Page was no longer part of Team Trump. But we now know from Rep. Adam Schiff, leader of the Democratic Minority on the House Intelligence Committee, that a FISA warrant had been granted –  with Mr. Page as its direct target – on October 21, 2016.Page made headlines on that trip, not least at Heat Street, the Dow Jones site whose editor I was. Could it be that both he and the Russian government revealed, in real time, their collusion? Masha Froliak reported that Page announced Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State at a press conference hosted by Sputnik – actually hosted by the Russian state –  in which he was grossly offensive about Hillary Clinton. More importantly, Tillerson had not yet been announced by Trump as his pick in America. Tillerson was announced on December 13th; but Page announced him on December 12th, the day before.Furthermore, Page had clearly not received this intelligence on the spur of the moment. He presented, without any ambiguity, Tillerson as Secretary of State using slides that had clearly been drawn up in advance; slides which featured photographs and graphics. These slides will doubtless feature in Bob Mueller’s investigation. We illustrated our piece using screengrabs from Russia Today’s video of the event. One slide featured an obviously “designed” graphic that was clearly not made by Page himself; with a side-by-side comparison of Hillary Clinton and Rex Tillerson’s “achievements” in regard to Russia, the graphic for the Clintons shows them all as Russian dolls, with the largest Russian doll being a figure of Monica Lewinsky. Reviewing the lecture and Froliak’s reporting, it is plain in retrospect that not only the graphics, but the text of the slides were provided to Page by Russian actors.It was a calculated insult to the United States to announce Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State in Moscow before Trump announced him in America. A cocky, even euphoric Russian media and government had clearly miscalculated dramatically over the strength of the US Constitution, the NATO alliance and the USIC. During this period, Russia was engaging in face to face communication with Trump’s team both in Washington and Moscow. (That was partly because of my own reporting, oddly enough. Sources told me much later that as soon as I published the FISA story on both Russian banks’ servers, talking to the Trump server, being under a FISA warrant, they ceased to communicate with Alfa Bank in Moscow; Team Trump and Team Putin then needed human contact, believing email to be unsafe).In early December, Ambassador Kislyak met Flynn, Bannon and Jared Kushner at Trump Tower. At that meeting, Kislyak and Kushner set up the January 11th Erik Prince-Kirill Dimitriev meeting.  Kislyak subsequently met with Avi Berkowitz, formerly of the “Trump Data” team, to ask that Kushner meet the Russian banker, Sergei Gorkov, a Russian intelligence and government proxy.Carter Page then traveled to Moscow, apparently to receive and relay messages – orders, in fact – between Putin’s government and Team Trump. And this is not speculation – it is fact, confessed by both sides at the time. Carter Page said:He also said he was in Moscow to meet with “thought leaders”.  Sadly for both Carter Page and Vladimir Putin, Sputnik, which is an official government entity, said thatIn summary, then, Carter Page in Moscow, in Dec 2016:Jack Kingston, the Russia Today pundit, accompanied Carter Page to Russia by design, joining in meetings and discussing sanction repeal – absolutely illegal while Obama was President. Kingston lied that he was a private person, but at the same time admitted he had a role in Trump’s campaign:The American Chamber of Commerce in Russia billed Kingston openly as acting as “a senior adviser to President-Elect Donald Trump”. In a paragraph all involved will regret, they detailed Kingston’s status with the Campaign and Mike Pence. “He participated in the campaign’s daily briefings…. his relationship with Team Members is extensive… he served as Senior Adviser to Trump during the campaign”Both my FISA article of Nov 7th, and Paul Wood’s article for the BBC in January 2017, reported that the FISA warrant of October 15th, targeted at two Russian banks, was intended to cover three individuals working with the Trump campaign, plus Mr. Trump himself, although we both acknowledged that the Russian banks were the target. Neither of us named the three individuals at that time. Later, I reported on this blog that the three Trump campaign associates were Page, Manafort and Epshteyn. Wood, myself and the Guardian’s Julian Borger all reported that a June application to FISC had failed.The reason that I, as the journalist who broke the story, did not name the Trump associates was that Mr. Epshteyn was not officially part of the campaign. I described him as a “media surrogate” as distinct from Page and Manafort, both of whom had officially been part of the campaign at one point. However, at Patribotics I was able to report on Epshteyn as a public figure because he then became officially part of the Trump Transition team. (Mr. Epshteyn is, incidentally, the only figure in the Trump Russia affair that I have actually called a ‘Russian spy’ as opposed to a Russian asset. My sources, multiple Western intelligence sources from more than one nation, state that Epshteyn is an FSB agent. He adamantly denies it.)Devin Nunes inspired me to write that piece naming the FISA targets. On Dec 11th, the day before Page’s Moscow speech, Nunes wroteIndeed. Nunes probably acted as a cut-out: Page is told whom Moscow has picked as Secretary of State, Page calls Devin Nunes from Moscow, and Devin Nunes tells Trump. If I am correct, then this call or calls will be on legally admissible intercepts, gathered under a FISA warrant. Not only will Carter Page be going to jail, Devin Nunes will too.Nunes notorious press conference in March after his trip to the White House – in which his former counsel Michael Ellis leaked intelligence transcripts to him – appears in retrospect to confirm this theory. Politico reported that Nunes’ complaints of “unmasking” were in fact invented. Adam Schiff said:Mr. Nunes flat panic indicates that he saw a reference to himself in those transcripts. That would mean that he knows that Page – the legal target of a FISA warrant – was recorded, and he is “US Person X” in those transcripts.In March, the press was confused by the Nunes reference to “incidental collection”, assuming that he must be talking about Kislyak intercepts with Mike Flynn. FISA warrants are normally granted on foreign entities; the direct targeting of Carter Page was very unusual, and the press had no idea that Page was under a FISA warrant in December. It should be noted that Nunes said that Trump, too, appears on these transcripts.To recap my piece, I chose to reveal that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were named in the June FISA warrant application because Devin Nunes was revealing evidence on live TV. On March 19th, Nunes said to Fox’s Chris WallaceSo Nunes literally broadcast to America that he knew a White House staffer was under investigation and surveillance!On March 24th, Director Comey arrived at the White House. On March 27th, Boris Epshteyn unceremoniously resigned. Some time after this, I reported exclusively, and events subsequently confirmed, that Devin Nunes had his clearance – access to view TS/SCI materials – stripped, leaving him only with ‘Top Secret’ access. He was unable to write the nonsense Nunes memo because, as Adam Schiff pointed out, despite being chairman of the House intelligence committee, Nunes is unable to look at the upper Top Secret classification.I am confident that all Mr. Page’s conversations from Moscow are on legal intercepts that Mueller can use in court; and that Devin Nunes is on those intercepts.EXCLUSIVE: Devin Nunes Has Top Secret Clearance Revoked"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199916162815840a3ba16"},"text":"Exclusive: Peter Chayanov, the Russian hacker who gave Wikileaks servers in Moscow a week before the release of the Podesta emails, is directly linked both to the Russian mob “laundromat” that was involved in the Sergei Magnitsky case, and the Russian government’s distribution of funds into the GOP.The Russian Embassy in the UK, among other official Russian government sites, was quick to challenge both Robert Mueller and US investigative journalists after the early indictments of over a dozen Russians who had catfished unwitting Americans.“Foreign Minister Lavarov: no evidence of Russian state interference in US elections has ever been presented,” they wrote, adding an image of a blackboard with chalk lettering saying “Can you prove it?” with a large question mark.Here we demonstrate, with sources linked to within the text:Mr. Chayanov, in short, may be regarded as a “one-stop shop” in the matter of Russia’s hacks of America and its money laundered to the GOP. He is indisputably responsible for assisting Wikileaks, news broken in this blog by Laurelai Bailey, a socialist activist, former U.S. veteran and an original Wikileaker.Records held at Companies House, the official UK registrar of businesses, show that Peter Chayanov and Stephen John Kelly were directors of a company called Optimal Telecom.Stephen John Kelly is a key name in the pursuit by Bill Browder and Hermitage Capital of the tax refund that Mr. Magnitsky discovered, and which was embezzled by the Russian mafia under the guidance and direction of Vladimir Putin. Public reporting tied Kelly to the murder case of the Russian whistleblower Alexander Perepilichnyy, a Magnitsky witness, found dead in his estate in Surrey, England in 2012.Mr. Browder’s office pointed to their research into the laundering of the money Sergei Magnitsky found, and was killed for exposing. ‘There are so many crimes that need their proceeds laundered, it is not practicable for them to set up a separate distribution network for each crime,’ Mr. Browder told us. ‘As a result, there is a well used ‘pipeline’ operation through which the [Russian] government and the Russian FSB launder their criminal funds.”Stephen John Kelly was part of that pipeline as a sort of ‘Director for hire’. He is a director of numerous companies featured in the Panama Papers, and is or was a director of 434 companies registered in the UK alone.The Chayanov-Kelly company Optimal Telecom is not listed as having received the money Sergei Magnitsky discovered, and was murdered over; rather, its use of Kelly indicates it was part of the same money-laundering network used to distribute that money on behalf of the Putin regime and the Russian mob.Optimal Telecom Seems to Have Distributed Russian Money to GOP CandidatesOptimal Telecom’s archived web records show that its international partners included “Prioritel LLC” in the United States. Although it’s listed as an American partner, the website had a .ru address, indicating the site was hosted in Russia. There appears to have been a concerted effort to wipe the captures of Prioritel LLC in Webarchive, but this effort was not totally successful, and the one remaining record has been copied to other archives and screenshot.Although it was linked as a “US partner”, Prioritel LLC was using a .ru internet address, indicating it was Russian. Prioritel LLC shows up in the state of Nevada, where, as is common in money laundering, it links to multiple entities with the same or a similar name.A managing entity for the company, for example, was “Prioritel Holdings, Inc.” That shell corporation was managed by one Mr. Frederick Andresen.  Andresen is involved with Alfa Bank, who had a server communicating with Trump Tower which, I reported at Heat Street the day before the election, was under a FISA warrant. In 2002 an FCC document shows that Andresen had transferred control of Prioritel LLC to one “Irina Grishanova“, yet through a shell he was controlling the thing again as recently as two years ago.This may be of serious interest to Mr. Mueller, as alibiz.com lists “Priorities Inc”, a Nevada company with the exact same two principals  – Andresen and Grishanova – as having ten million dollars a year in revenue.It is beyond the scope of this article to examine all the shell companies connected to Prioritel LLC and Optimal Telecom (Chayanov, Stephen John Kelly). But one representative example of money laundering to the GOP is “Priorities Nevada Inc.” This little not for profit, related to the first company in Nevada records, was formed in 2015 – when Director Comey testified he first became aware of Russian efforts to influence the election – and dissolved in May 2016, after Trump met and spoke with Sergei Kislyak at the Mayfair hotel.Why would a non-profit be set up and dissolved so quickly? Because non-profits are subject to a different tax regimen. Principles included Ciara Matthews, the pro-russian spokesman of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, and Amy Tarkanian, the wife of GOP candidate Danny Tarkanian.Danny Tarkanian and Amy Tarkanian are pro-Trump, pro “America First”, and were recently shilling in praise of convicted felon and NRA supporter Dinesh D’Souza.Amy Tarkanian, whose name is on the Priorities Nevada state records, was also retweeting pro-Russian Rand Paul’s attacks on the Pentagon. Amy Tarkanian is a regular contributor to Russia Today. Under new laws, she may need to register as a foreign agent of the Russian state under FARA, as all Sputnik and Russia Today employees as required to do. Failing to register under FARA is a felony crime.Given that Amy Tarkanian’s PAC is linked to Peter Chayanov, the host of Wikileaks’ Russian servers, both Amy and her husband Danny may find themselves in deep trouble. What was the price of whatever part of that ten million dollars a year from Chayanov’s partners Prioritel? We don’t have to look any closer than Amy and Danny’s twitter feeds:“I always enjoy going on Russia Today  @NewswithEd ..thanks for having me on again today. (Not him in the picture, that’s the other guest)” she gushes. ,"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199916162815840a3ba17"},"text":"Over the past year there have been a number of articles, TV commentaries and threads on social media about the vexatious word “collusion”. What is the Trump Russia probe about? There is no specific crime of ‘collusion’. So what does that mean for the overall case?Words do have power. It is why I dislike the media’s use of the term ‘meddling’, more appropriately used of a busybody grandmother bossing her daughter in law around over the Thanksgiving gravy than a nuclear power’s attack on the constitution of the United States. So a debate about ‘collusion’ is perfectly fair.However, it has led to a number of commentators speculating that Mueller is here to play small ball; that he will not be looking at what ordinary people mean by the word “collusion”, an overall pattern of co-ordinating assistance in the election to Donald Trump from the Russian state and people acting on its behalf; and an equal pattern of Trump and his associates accepting Russia’s attacks on Hillary Clinton.These commentators seek to downplay the extraordinary attack on America that this would represent, if Mueller can prove it. US elections are for the people of the United States. A candidate who was elected to the Presidency with the help of a foreign power, who knowingly accepted that help for himself and accepted attacks on his opponents, would be guilty of the highest crimes against the United States. He would have betrayed his country and his fellow Americans. He would have cheated his way into office, and stolen the voting rights of every American, both those that supported him and those that did not.Those who say “collusion” is not a crime are dishonestly implying that the act of collusion does not encompass a vast range of crimes which carry the severest penalties. Espionage, for example, is a capital crime.James Comey, in his testimony before Congress, made this clear when he said he had not used the word “collusion”- but was looking for specific examples of “coordination”.Comey said:This answer should settle much of the debate about the word “collusion” and whether Mueller is playing for some minor, unimportant charges on peripheral matters.“Collusion” is not a crime, but neither is “coordination”. Yet Comey’s answer says, in bullet points:Joy Ann Reid, a morning anchor on MSNBC, posted a series of tweets that reflect this tendency to trivialize what Mueller is looking for. She said:Reid dismayed many of her naturally liberal followers with this assessment. She says people ‘may’ have committed crimes, when two of the four charged have already pled guilty; more importantly, though, Reid says that there might be “some potentially serious” crimes involved.What? Huh? Potentially serious? We have been told in terms by the then Director of the FBI that a massive counterintelligence and criminal probe is going on examining Russian interference in a US election, and that the said probe is examining co-ordination between the victorious candidate’s campaign and associates and this foreign power. And yet Reid – like too many of her colleagues – is downplaying this into national commentary  that there may be some potentially serious crimes involved.Coordination with a foreign power to suborn a United States election is as serious as crime gets. There is nothing more serious.The above commentary by Reid was made as she praised a thread by another journalist, Ron Fein, of ‘Free Speech For People’, founded by an alt-left stalwart John Bonifaz.*  Fein follows the same damaging path; he cites many reasons that “collusion” is not a crime, but his thread boils down to the offenses he argues Mueller is looking at prosecuting:If you look these up, they are mickey mouse offenses of campaign contributions and illegal pac coordination with small penalties.But this idea – that the FBI, whose formal investigation into the Trump campaign began in July after Carter Page returned from Russia, and who had, as part of a six-agency task force, been looking at money laundering into the campaign from Russia from April of 2016 – and its effective successor in the investigation, the Special Counsel’s Office – is looking at tiny, maybe, possibly, offenses of tax penalties and PAC coordinations, after spending seven to nine months on this matter, is ludicrous on its face.The co-ordination that Comey and Mueller are examining is of a national security level with concomitant penalties. Will lesser offenses be prosecuted? Certainly. But is that what Mueller is looking to bring before the nation? It is not. He will either broadly clear Trump and his campaign or he will adduce serious crimes. Let us look at a section of the “Comey Day” testimony of June 8th, where Director Comey spoke of the investigation after he was fired by Trump:Very serious indeed, then.But what is this? If we examine the third transcript of Director Comey’s testimony, that of his answers to the Senate Judiciary committee in May, just before he was fired, he uses the word “collusion” and he uses it as a synonym for “coordination” in response to an astute question by Senator Al Franken:Franken is asking a very pointed question – were the actions of Russian trolls and bots, both human and automated, on social media co-ordinated with the Trump campaign? And Comey basically says: it was the purpose of my investigation to determine this.The May 3rd Q\u0026A between Franken and Comey reinforces my own reporting of April 1st, when I broke the story that the Alfa and Spectrum Health servers were being used to co-ordinate social media bots and trolls against Hillary Clinton and for Donald Trump. I called that report “A Social Media Impeachment”. Much later, Michael Isikoff confirmed my report of April in his piece of December 27th:The story, which is oddly headlined “Mueller probe outgrows its ‘witch hunt’ phase” – it has never been a witch hunt, although I must make it clear that often journalists do not write the headlines that attach to their pieces  – aligns with, even if it does not wholly confirm, several other of my reports from last spring – that the GOP itself is under a RICO investigation for accepting money from Russians at the Republican Convention, run by the Republican National Committee or RNC: that Reince Priebus, then chairman of the RNC, was taped, as was Speaker Paul Ryan, at this convention, accepting money from Sergei Kislyak, the Russian Ambassador.Mueller is not playing small ball."}

The AP reported recently that at least 200 Western journalists, including at least 50 at the New York Times, were hacked by Russia since 2014, with attacks continuing to the present day.Patribotics sources specify that hacks starting for 2014 during the Sochi Olympics were unrelated, but had a similar objective. By contrast, the hack on the Moscow bureau of the Times was intended specifically to gather kompromat on journalists to force favorable coverage in the matter of the US election of Donald Trump, these sources said.Sources stated that the penetration of the small Moscow Bureau of the Times allowed hackers working for Russian intelligence services access to valuable digital intelligence on the New York Times’ communication network systems in the United States, including credentials. The Times has been a particular target, these sources said, because of its status as ‘the paper of record’ in the United States and particularly because of its liberal readership.The Moscow Bureau of the Times was attacked, it was reported last August. At the time, the paper denied that any of its systems had been compromised.One source of this site laughed aloud when we raised the Times’ statement that they had found no evidence the paper’s systems were penetrated. The paper only admitted to being “targeted” by hackers.‘APT28 wasn’t able to get into the Times’ emails?’ this source said. ‘Look, if a nation state APT puts you in its sights, eventually they’ll get you. APT28 easily has the capability to pull it off. Ask the DNC.’“APT” is an abbreviation for Advanced Persistent Threat, a designation reserved for the most advanced cyber threat actors in the world– usually groups backed by nation-states. The state of Russia is known to run several APTs in different areas of their security apparatus, teams that often compete internally with each other. The Times fired its Public Editor, Liz Spayd, who reported that the New York Times knew of FISA warrants sought in the Trump-Russia campaign when this reporter broke that story at Heat Street, but failed to report them. The Times dismayed its readership base with a number of stories, during the election and subsequently, that seemed plainly to misstate the facts or praise Donald Trump. In other cases, the Times failed to levy criticism of white nationalists.The Times most recently published a story detailing how George Papadopolous confided to an Australian diplomat in London that the Russians had hacked Secretary Clinton; this story ran with the factually false headline “How the Russia Inquiry Began”. (The BBC’s Paul Wood had already reported, nearly a year earlier, that a six-agency task force including the FBI was started in April 2016; James Comey testified that Russian attempts to interfere in the US election process were known to him from 2015 onwards). The AP story cited a specific APT, APT28, which it called “Iron Twilight”, that it said was identified by the national security firm Secureworks as involved in phishing emails from politicians and journalists. The USIC has identified several APTs involved in the attacks as contractors working for the FSB rather than agents directly employed by the agencies, sources said. This method attempts to give the Russian state a measure of deniability, sources said. However, American agencies have firmly identified contractor work as having been sourced, paid for and ordered by the highest echelons of the Russian state.The New York Times, in reporting the attack on their Moscow office, only headlined their story that they had been “targeted”. The paper said last August:The New York Times may, however, only have examined the Moscow bureau and not have looked into the main New York Times systems in the United States thinking the attack was contained to local systems, sources speculated.So far, the New York Times has failed to correct or rescind its errors in its Trump Russia coverage, including the story that possibly swayed the election result, “Investigating Donald Trump, FBI Sees No Clear Link to Russia”."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199916162815840a3ba19"},"text":"Exclusive: sources with links to American and Australian intelligence report that the Senate Intelligence Committee’s letter to Mike Pence, demanding information on his knowledge of Mike Flynn’s links to Russia, Turkey but also to China, relates to Erik Prince’s paid work for Chinese intelligence.Robert Mueller’s investigation is focused on crimes of obstruction of justice and lying to the FBI, sources said. Vice President Pence headed the transition team, which is under investigation for multiple criminal acts, including the exposure of American assets in Russia, thought to have been performed by Boris Epshteyn. In the spring, sources told Patribotics that Mr. Epshteyn was an agent of the FSB, or Russian intelligence, as opposed to a mere asset of Russia. This outlet reported exclusively that Epshteyn was one of four men named in James Comey’s first application to FISC, the court that decides whether or not to to grant a FISA warrant, in June, the other three being Carter Page, Paul Manafort and Donald Trump.That application failed. This reporter broke that news at Heat Street, a Dow Jones publication, last November. Mike Pence has, sources say, committed a number of crimes, some which do not involve national security and which took place while Pence was still Governor of Indiana. I am withholding reporting on those offenses at the request of sources. Mr. Pence is, however, currently under the spotlight in both criminal and congressional inquiries for the transition team’s knowledge of criminal acts that took place while Mike Flynn was the incoming National Security Adviser. Mr. Mueller requested documents from the White House in August in order to determine, sources reported, whether or not they matched with the list of documents Mr. Flynn had already provided to James Comey and the FBI when he first flipped in the spring. This is because Mr. Mueller is looking at the White House transition team for obstruction of justice charges, as well as more serious counts, such as espionage in the case of Mr. Epshteyn.That Erik Prince formed a ‘back channel’ to Russia has already been widely reported. What is far less well known, however, is that Prince was also working closely with Chinese intelligence. China aided Russia in its attack on US intelligence last year. The Steele dossier mentioned China in terms of the Trump family’s business interests.Sally Yates was fired after her warnings about Mike Flynn stripped White House Counsel Don McGahn of some of his deniability, sources said.Erik Prince, unable to work in the United States, turned to Chinese intelligence for work some years ago. Former U.S. Ranger and author Jack Murphy broke this news for the military news site SOFREP in March:Jared Kushner is today revealed to have told Flynn to contact Russia. Kushner and Ivanka Trump are both on signals intelligence, or SIGINT, gathered by Australian intelligence, sources with links to that country’s intelligence services reported. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump are suspected of having asked China for payoffs washed through property dealings. When Erik Prince was unable properly to communicate with governmental officials based on his links to China being discovered, Mike Flynn was deputed to carry on that “business” for the Trumps and Kushners in his place, sources said.The Russia-friendly online magazine ‘The Intercept’ ran a negative piece on Erik Prince’s links to China in March of 2016. This piece appears to have been planted by allies of Russia and China, working for Oleg Deripaska, in order to warn the perpetrators – namely Prince and his friends in the Trump camp – that his links to China have been discovered. Sources with links to the intelligence community have described this technique to me as “front face to warn”. To “front face” a piece of secret intelligence is to deliberately leak it to the public, with the intent for it to be widely known.Mike Flynn has not been accused of setting up ‘back channels’ to Russia as both Jared Kushner and Erik Prince have been. Rather, his indictment has him openly setting policy for the United States with Russia, on the very day when President Obama, as Commander in Chief, was acting against them, as a hostile nation, for their attack on the US election. In the same way, the Senate is examining whether or not Mike Flynn was an ‘open channel’ to China for the enrichment of the Trumps and Kushners while Erik Prince performed this function in the background.Jared Kushner and Erik Prince’s recent re-emergence on our television screens is no accident, sources said."}

The referendum on remaining part of the EU received so much illegal foreign money and influence from Russia, these sources say, that UK intelligence is minded to recommend to Theresa May’s government that the Brexit vote be redone, as it is not thought that the vote was ‘free and fair’. This term is often used in Great Britain to describe a legitimate election process.It is illegal under UK electoral law for foreign nationals and entities to spend sums of money influencing domestic votes. The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, sources said, was quite clear on the illegality of such donations.This reporter broke the story, last year, that the same Russian entities that were pushing botnets for Trump were pushing them for Brexit, and for Marine le Pen and Viktor Orban. The level of money and the reach of the fake bots and targeted data funded by Russia, using Cambridge Analytica, sources said, was so great that MI5 and MI6, the UK’s versions of the FBI and CIA, did not believe that the Brexit referendum could have been said to have been ‘free and fair’.Sources cautioned, however, that an absolute decision had not yet been made and that the Prime Minister and her government opposed a revote. Reasons for this included both the public reaction, and the fact that it is thought that any second vote is likely to have the same final result as the first one. Sources with links to both UK and US intelligence also believed, however, that there was major anxiety within the British government – among all major parties – of politicians’ links to the Russian state being exposed.The resulting scandal could be worse than the ‘MPs’ expenses’ scandal of 2009, which caught hundreds of MPs up in a corruption probe over petty larceny paid for by taxpayers, where British politicans charged personal items as ‘expenses’ necessary for their work to the public purse.Sources were aware that Russian money had flowed into more UK electoral processes than just the Brexit vote. Russia piled into the Scottish independence referendum on behalf of the SNP; the former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, has just accepted a chat show on the UK version of Russia Today, Putin’s state propaganda channel. In America, Russia Today have been forced to register as foreign agents under FARA (the foreign agents’ registration act).Russia has also backed Jeremy Corbyn, in an apparent fit of anger towards Theresa May for the UK’s assistance to the US intelligence community; and UKIP, the party led by Nigel Farage. UKIP’s leaders are under an active USIC investigation for colluding with Russia in the matter of Donald Trump’s election campaign. We plan a further report on Nigel Farage shortly. Sources speculated, without certainty, that any re-do of a corrupted Brexit vote might be announced after the arrest of Nigel Farage, which, separate sources assert, is a certainty.Several sources with knowledge of the matter indicated that the intelligence community was not likely to be swayed by political considerations from making its recommendation. Analysis was not merely based on logging the amount of money and the number of social media profiles affected, they said, but on SIGINT, or signals intelligence – that is, recordings and other legal interceptions of politicians, Russian agents and assets, and of tracking laundered money, including by tracking the use of bitcoin, that flowed from Vladimir Putin into the Brexit referendum.GCHQ, as we have previously reported, recorded Steve Mnuchin, Donald Trump and others at Trump Turnberry on June 24th, 2016, the day after Brexit. All attending that event and the weekend with Mr. Trump that followed it were under constant surveillance, sources said. At that weekend, the deal outlined at Trump Tower on June 9th, 2016, was finalized – Trump would alter policy in America, on both sanctions and Ukraine, in exchange for Russia’s help in hacking the election. Brexit and Cambridge Analytica were crucial to ‘proving’ to Trump that Putin and his assets could hand an election victory, against the odds, to the GOP’s candidate. Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer were crucial links in Putin’s twin assaults on the UK and US electoral systems; they were heavily involved with UKIP, Cambridge Analytica, Brexit and then the Trump campaign."}

Flynn broke down and sobbed, sources familiar with the matter said, when faced with the extent of the signals intelligence, or SIGINT, against himself and Mike Flynn Jr. Senior law enforcement officials presented Donald Trump’s former National Security adviser, already indicted at the time for failure to register as a foreign agent of Turkey, with irrefutable evidence of espionage committed on behalf of the Russian state by both himself and his son and business partner, Mike Flynn Jr. Espionage is a capital crime.Separate sources with links to the intelligence community and the Justice Department report that a deal for leniency for his son offered to General Flynn, on which we exclusively reported earlier this year, may have been derailed by Mike Flynn Jr’s compulsive tweeting of divisive, pro-Kremlin propaganda.As NBC news reports that Mueller is about to bring charges against both Mike Flynn and his son, we review our exclusive reporting on both Flynn and his son and the indictments that may be unsealed shortly.In May, we broke the news that General Flynn had ‘flipped’, or had gone in to speak to the FBI. At that time, Mike Flynn was under indictment for failing to register as a foreign agent for Turkey under FARA, the Foreign Agents’ Registration Act.General Flynn, sources reported, was arrogant and unconcerned. The charge of failing to register under FARA might only result in a term-limited prison sentence. Flynn had resigned as NSA and believed himself present in the FBI’s offices to discuss the terms of a deal on this charge.Sources said that General Flynn did indeed discuss this offense, which was admitted, with FBI agents. However, they reported that after a brief period, a senior official entered the room and confronted General Flynn with knowledge of his wider conspiracy in Russia’s interference in the election. An outline of a case for espionage, a capital crime, where the default penalty is death, was made to Flynn senior, involving both himself and his son Mike Flynn Jr. While sources were not specific, they reported that the conversation involved both men’s knowing propagation, and co-ordination, with the Kremlin, of Russian propaganda, using an Artificial Intelligence ‘data weapon’ precisely to target that propaganda on social media. This technology and the way it was employed is also said to feature in an espionage investigation that is ongoing against Bob Mercer, sources say.We exclusively reported these crimes in our story ‘Mike Flynn’s Treason Tour‘,  which describes how Flynn and his son assisted Vladimir Putin in targeting Russian propaganda not only in the United States, but also right across Europe.Sources stated that senior officials told General Flynn that they had what they needed to prosecute him and his son, and that they would seek the death penalty. Separate sources reported that General Flynn broke down and wept, asking that the death penalty for espionage not be sought for his son.Sources with links to law enforcement and the justice department stated that at first, senior officials declined to offer a deal of any sort. Later, they became amenable, these sources said. General Flynn was offered a stark choice; co-operate and spare your son execution, but no such promise was made as regards his own trial.Mr. Flynn did then co-operate, sources said.Mike Flynn Jr. angrily denied to this reporter the accounts given her by multiple separate sources, on separate occasions, of what his father had done for him, and in such a way that led her to believe that Flynn Jr. did not know. If correct, this would necessarily mean that the FBI had not allowed General Flynn to discuss his knowledge of the charges against father and son with his co-conspirator.Despite this, General Flynn was required to put a brake on Mike Flynn Jr.’s divisive propaganda on Twitter, sources said. The younger Flynn was, however, so addicted to tweeting hate-ridden Russian messaging, these sources said, that the Special Counsel’s office decided at one point that the deal had been violated. It was after Flynn Sr. was informed of that decision that he began to fund-raise for his defense, sources said.Anything General Flynn would have admitted prior to this would still be admissible at trial, sources reported. At time of writing, I do not know whether or not the Special Counsel’s team had a change of heart over honoring their deal for leniency for the younger Flynn following further information received from Mike Flynn Senior.Note: New charges do not necessarily mean new indictments, but they can do.A ‘charge’ is only leveled when an indictment is made public. Therefore, charges may be new for indictments that have been returned by a Grand Jury many months prior. Mr. Mueller may choose to indict General Flynn on some, but not all, of the possible charges against him, as he did with Paul Manafort."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199926162815840a3ba1c"},"text":"By Peter Evans Most are now well aware of Russia’s attack on the US Electoral process. Current ongoing investigations , both Congressional and by the Special Counsel are almost daily revealing the breadth and depth of Russian operations against the United States. Many have referred to the Russia’s Gerasimov Doctrine, more commonly known as Hybrid War, as the operational basis behind the Strategic Planning that Putin has and is utilizing in his ongoing “Shadow War” against the Western Allies. Russian doctrine in this space is somewhat similar to the old Soviet Operational planning in this area but with some key differences. Hybrid War doctrine tries to avoid actual armed conflict to achieve national objectives , stressing the coordinated use of all levers of Government be that Diplomatic, Economic, Intelligence, Technical \u0026 Informal personal  relationships to “shape the battlespace” and to surreptitiously penetrate a target country with the aim of  This is Asymmetrical Geopolitical warfare using conventional and unconventional methods to achieve national outcomes that, in this case, are for the ultimate benefit of Vladimir Putin and those close to him. But what else is Russia up to? And more importantly with whom?Russia, more than most, does things strategically. It has always placed great importance on long term planning. Operationally they coordinate all aspects of planning and they integrate all operations they carry out to their strategic objectives.The attack on the 2016 US Election was not just an isolated operation in response to US sanctions of Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea.And in this Putin had a partner in crime.In 2010 the then Vice President of the People’s Republic of China, Xi Jinping, visited Moscow at the express invitation of then Prime Minister Putin. Xi was slated to take over as China’s President in 2012. Putin was due to stand for “election” to become Russia’s President at about the same time. Both were deeply concerned about the direction of the Obama Administration’s towards their respective countries. The two men by all accounts formed a close and warm relationship from the outset.Both Xi and Putin talked extensively about global power moving from a Unipolar World (read US leadership) to a Multi Polar World (Russia \u0026 China leading with some minor other players). Both men made it clear they were against what they saw as American values (liberal Democracy) being pushed unfettered around the world. They saw these values as neither universal nor applicable to them or their Governments.In December 2010 a series of uprisings, beginning in Tunisia and spreading to Libya, Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain occurred. This became known as the Arab Spring. Protests occurred in a number of other Arab countries also, notably Saudi Arabia, Lebanon \u0026 Iran.But what rattled leaders in the Middle East was President Obama’s support of the uprisings in Egypt ,Syria and Libya.China and Russia both were against the US supporting these uprisings with Russia describing it as “Western Belligerence”. Leaders across the Arab world became nervous about US policy to their own regimes, particularly after close US Ally Hosni Mubarak in Egypt was seen by many Arab leaders to have been “abandoned” by Obama in favour of the will of the Egyptian people.Both Russia \u0026 China subsequently increased their diplomacy \u0026 presence in the Middle East via economic and in Russia’s case , military footprint in Syria. The message to the Arab Leaders was clear. You have alternatives to America. Relations with the Obama administration continued to erode with both Russia and China.In 2012 Congress passed the Magnitsky Act which President Obama signed. This directly affected for the first time the illegal financial activities of Putin and the Oligharchs that supported him. Vladimir Putin saw this as a direct assault on himself by President Obama \u0026 Secretary of State Clinton.Similarly, the Chinese Government had much to be annoyed about with US policy. Obama, at the urging of SecState Clinton, had begun the Asia Pivot, a refocusing of American economic and military power in the Western Pacific Asia area. China saw this as an attempt to keep them from their rightful place as a Great Power.In late 2012 Xi Jinping was confirmed as President of China. His first overseas trip was to Russia in early 2013. By this time Vladimir Putin was again President of Russia.At this point Hillary Clinton had resigned as Secretary of State and President Obama had just started his second term. It must have been obvious to both men that she was preparing to run for President in 2016. This was the nightmare they faced. An American administration that would continue with Obama’s policies of supporting Democracy movements and resisting China and Russia’s ambitions. The genesis of the idea may have started in the years before when they first met. Certainly by 2013 Xi and Putin, I put to you, agreed to work together to actively undermine the United States political process, if for nothing else, to prevent a Democratic successor to Obama. It is important to note that from this time onward Russia and China agreed to dramatically increase cooperation in all areas including Military \u0026 Intelligence sharing.Putin by this time was already well aware that Republican strategist Paul Manafort was working for the then Russian supported Ukraine dictator  Viktor Yanukovych. Putin would have also known about Donald Trump and the birther claims he made against Obama and how Obama had humiliated him at the 2011 Press Correspondents Dinner. By Donald Trump’s own admission, he was phoned by Putin in Nov 2013. We don’t know if there was contact between the two men prior to that.Trump and his adult children had extensive business contacts and interests in both Russia and China. There were multiple leverage points on Trump and his children. Putin also knew Trump had extensive shadow relationships to Russian mobsters. The mark was chosen.Putin and Xi would have seen the original success of President Obama in the 2008 election was derived in a great part , by the online campaign the Obama Team was able to formulate and that massive influence internet operations had to Obama’s success. This was Putin and Xi’s way in, they saw. A low risk, high gain Hybrid War Operation. At this point it is instructive to illustrate how China has conducted itself internationally in its own “Hybrid War” tactics, especially since Xi came to power.Both US and Australian Intelligence agencies have stated that Chinese Intelligence organs use China’s international businesses and nationals to conduct intelligence operations against the West. This includes theft of information and intellectual property, penetration of databases, and influence operations. In the Australian context, this included hacks into several Australian Government databases and servers, use of Chinese students studying in Australia to promote Chinese Government objectives and attempts to influence Australian Government policy through political donations or payments via third parties. In a recent case a member of the Australian Parliament, Sam Dastyari , was found to have received payments from a Chinese national in order to support the Chinese Governments position regarding the South China Sea dispute.Since Xi came to power these types of operations have been stepped up exponentially.So, one may ask, how sure am I China that was part of the 2016 US Election attack? The most prominent give away was Donald Trump’s opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP. The TPP was not just an economic pact, it would have also effectively been a security pact against Chinese economic hegemony across the Asia-Pacific. It would have protected smaller nations from economic pressure that China could exert on them and the Pact specifically excluded China. Xi complained loud and hard about the TPP. The TPP would have actually protected American jobs and economic power in the long term. It was not just Steve Bannon, who only officially came to the campaign in August 2016, who opposed it. Trump was opposing it as early as late 2015. For an international businessman it was a stunning policy to have. But not if he was following Russia \u0026 China’s wishes.Furthermore, what have we seen since Trump was inaugurated on January 20th? China has launched its own version of the TPP, the New Silk Road and Belt, a development that will see roads, ports, rail links and oil \u0026 gas pipelines stretching from Central Europe and Russia, through Turkey, Iran and Central Asia to China. Additionally the ocean side of this, the “Belt” will link to Malaysia, Pakistan and Kenya with a rail line running through Kenya to East Africa.Oil \u0026 Gas from Russian and Arab countries will run directly to China over land through pipelines. Strategically that would somewhat nullify the US Navy’s ability to interdict or blockade Oil and Gas supplies to China in any future conflict.We have also seen China \u0026 Russia accelerating business investments in the Middle East, with Russia playing a lead political role with Saudi Arabia and Iran. Under Trump, America is slowly losing influence in the Middle East and appears to be in lockstep with Russian \u0026 Chinese political \u0026 economic objectives for the area. And Arab leaders appear to be going along with itThe fact of the matter is this. China had as much to lose , if not more, had Hillary Clinton won the 2016 Election. Putin and Xi planned this operation together. Russia took the lead as it had the most contacts with the American players on Trump’s side. China provided technical and general intelligence support to the Operation.The international intrigue we are seeing now over with North Korea is nothing but a Kabuki Dance designed to confuse and distract the Western public from what is really going on. North Korea would not scratch its nose without China \u0026 Russia’s say so, let alone fire missiles.Fact is that the biggest geopolitical heist in history occurred when Donald J Trump was elected as President. Because he was elected not by the people, for the people, but by and for the interests of the Russian Federation – and the People’s Republic of China."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab199926162815840a3ba1d"},"text":"Exclusive: Multiple sources with links to the justice and intelligence communities report that Special Counsel Mueller has dozens of sealed indictments against suspects in the Trump Russia scandal. There are now several sealed indictments against Donald Trump personally. This site exclusively reported the first indictment returned against Trump in May, a RICO charge involving Felix Sater, Bayrock, the Trump Organization, and agents of the Russian state.CNN broke the news that Robert Mueller would be revealing the first charge, or charges, in the Trump Russia investigation in the last week of October. Their reporting did not specify which suspects would be charged first.This article will attempt to summarize some of our reporting on evidence the Special Counsel has before him, and on existing sealed indictments. In a separate story, I will summarize which of my reports have been confirmed by the mainstream media.Donald Trump – indicted on RICO over the Felix Sater and Bayrock case, and on other charges which sources have requested we do not report.Mike Flynn – indicted for failing to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents’ Registration Act, as an agent of Turkey whilst National Security AdvisorWhile we are able to report that Special Counsel Mueller is holding dozens of sealed indictments, many of which were returned while James Comey was Director of the FBI, we cannot report with specificity who is indicted on what charge other than the two above, because sources were not specific. We have reported on the investigations suspects are facing, and these are listed below.Sources did not specify who was to be indicted under which offense. However, multiple sources did confirm that some categories of offense considered included, variously; espionage, a capital crime; obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice; violations of the Logan Act; lying to the FBI; failure to register under FARA; and RICO, not only in the matter of the Trump Organization, but also for the GOP as a body, taking Ambassador Kislyak’s money at the GOP convention, where both Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan were intercepted on Kislyak’s hot-miked phone.Donald Trump – RICO over Felix Sater, Bayrock, and other unnamed offenses. Mr. Trump is indicted. He is also under investigation for sexual abuse and human trafficking relating to Trump Models.Mike Pence –under investigation for lying to the FBI over Mike Flynn, conspiracy to obstruct justice over Flynn’s ties to Turkey and Russia, violating the Logan Act, and other serious unnamed offenses that sources refused to specify.Paul Ryan – under investigation for accepting Russian money from Sergei Kislyak at the GOP Convention and subsequently admitting that he knew it was being washed into the GOP.Rex Tillerson – under criminal  state investigation by NY AG Schneiderman for Exxon stock fraud over the ‘Wayne Tracker’ emails.Steve Mnuchin – the Treasury Secretary is under investigation for espionage and money laundering relating to Russian money pumped into Trump’s campaign. He was taped in Scotland by GCHQ, who have given the recordings to U.S. intelligence.Mike Flynn – while we reported that Flynn was indicted for FARA failure under Turkey, he can expect charges for espionage. His work for Putin involved co-ordinating Putin’s propaganda of hatred right across Europe as we reported. He additionally has been a knowing Russian asset since he was at the DIA. He used AI to coordinate Russian propaganda in the US election.Mike Flynn Jr  – also being investigated for espionage. His father had made a deal to spare the life of his son, we reported. That deal, separate sources said, was later nullified by the authorities because Flynn Jr. would not stop tweeting out divisive propaganda and hatred of the kind he propagated during the election, knowing it was from Russia.The Republican Party as a body is under investigation for RICO for accepting Russian money. The GOP itself is being considered to be a corrupt organization under the RICO statutes. Sources were firm that the GOP, as it is presently known, may no longer exist after this investigation and a new party of the right may have to form. Sources did not say if charges or indictments had been returned against the party however.Donald J Trump Jr and Eric Trump are under investigation for, among other offenses, knowingly allowing and abetting the use of the Kelhios botnet to steal credit card information in Trump hotels, which was sold on the darknet, in collusion with the Russia mob and Peter Levashov. This is why Ivanka Trump was removed from Trump Hotel companies by her father. His attempt to exculpate her was considered risible by sources familiar with the matter.Donald J Trump Jr is on tape colluding with Russia in France before the election. He is being investigated for collusion with Russia over the meeting that was taped in Trump Tower.(These are not intended to be exclusionary. We are aware of other offenses the Trump sons and their father are being investigated for and are withholding reporting at the request of sources).Ivanka Trump is being investigated for washing Russian money into Iran with her fraudulent Azerbijan hotel deal. She is under investigation for other activities about which we are preparing a separate story.Eric Trump, Brad Parscale, Jared Kushner, Pyotr Levashov, Michael Cohen and Boris Epshteyn (among several others) are under investigation for espionage, money laundering, and other offenses for the activities of the Alfa, Spectrum and Silicon Valley Bank servers washing hacked voter databases and the stolen DNC ‘Vertica’ database to the Trump Server. The Kelhios botnet was used to propagate the hack.Michael Cohen is under investigation for money laundering and, along with Boris Ephsteyn, paying hackers on behalf of Mr. Trump. as suggested in the Steele dossier.Paul Manafort is under more additional investigations than we have time to list here, including FARA violations, money laundering, RICO, bribery, espionage, lying to the FBI, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. That list is not meant to be exhaustive.Mitch McConnell is under investigation for violating the Logan Act by running his own foreign policy in Iran in defiance of President Obama, as well as for links to gun and drug runners linked to the MEK organization.Jason Chaffetz is under investigation for tweeting Director Comey’s letter, which was classified.Devin Nunes is under investigation for espionage. He is on SIGINT in Portugal colluding with Russia. He is also under investigation for obstruction of justice, for revealing earlier this year that “one member of the transition team” (which was Mr. Epshteyn) was under FBI investigation.Steve Bannon is under investigation for espionage for colluding with the Russian state. So are Nigel Farage and Dana Rohrabacher, who were taped by multiple Western nations on a fishing trip together and in the case of Mr. Farage on many other occasions.Julian Assange is under investigation for espionage. Nigel Farage acted as Trump’s courier to Assange. Wikileaks are regarded as an arm of the Russian state.Carter Page is under investigation for espionage. The tape, or recording, of Donald Trump agreeing to change sanctions policy for hacking help, which he took to Moscow, is in the hands of Bob Mueller. The first FISA application made in June 2016, which named Page, Manafort, Epshteyn and Trump, was made over their conversation with Sergei Kislyak in the Mayflower Hotel in which Trump agrees to do this. The FISA warrant application failed, sources speculated, because Trump may not have known at that time that he was being taped.Jeff Sessions is under investigation for espionage, obstruction of justice over the firing of Director Comey and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He has, however, co-operated with the authorities since Comey was fired and may have mitigated the penalties he would otherwise have incurred.We have no doubt that this list is not exhaustive.Read more of our exclusive Trump Russia journalism by following the links to the side or in the text."}

Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia,….”collusion,” which doesn’t exist. The Dems are using this terrible (and bad for our country) Witch Hunt for evil politics, but the R’s…..are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton, and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!”All of those tweets were made in sequence. An hour later, Mr. Trump added:“All of this “Russia” talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts \u0026 Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!”It should be noted that the initial public reason Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump gave for firing Director Comey was that he was too harsh on Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump later said on live television that it was actually over Comey’s Russia investigation.Also on Twitter, Andy Wigmore, the lieutenant to Nigel Farage who was recently questioned by Bob Mueller, wrote on Sunday morning that Mueller was going to be fired.The weekend saw a number of Trump Russia suspects publicly melting down over the expected arrest or arrests on Monday.Roger Stone Jr was been banned from Twitter after a series of ranting tweets sparked by CNN’s reporting:Mr. Stone, recently questioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee in open session, is important to the Trump Russia inquiry because he acted as a courier for Trump with Wikileaks, and co-ordinating the release of stolen information and targeted propaganda with Guccifer 2.Mr. Mueller’s probe, like Mr. Comey’s before him, regards Wikileaks as an agent of Russia. This is contrary to Mike Pompeo’s wrongful statement that Wikileaks is a “non-state” actor. Wikileaks was acting as the agent of a foreign power, in this case, Russia.The announcement that Mueller plans arrests has led to a number of panicked tweets by suspects in Trump Russia. Patribotics will publish a separate story tomorrow summarizing our extensive reporting, in preparation for arrests by the Special Counsel, detailing what we have reported on various Trump Russia principals, ranging from Donald Trump himself all the way down to the merely clownish, like Sean Hannity.Fox News’s Sean Hannity was quick off the mark:He added the rather impressive piece of projection:Sebastian Gorka, who worked closely with Steve Bannon and Mike Flynn co-ordinating Russia’s propaganda, demanded Mueller be fired and investigated:Trump could not resist a dig at Hillary Clinton, who unlike him, is not a suspect, saying “Now we know” [that Mrs. Clinton ‘played the press on Russia’]. He also seemed to have had the earliest warning of Mueller’s action, saying‘It is now commonly agreed, after many months of COSTLY looking, that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!’This co-ordinated line of pretense that Mrs. Clinton had “colluded” with Russia was repeated by both Trump sons, for reasons we shall detail in a separate piece: “Doesn’t surprise me at all. It would from anyone else though. How Team Hillary played the press for fools on Russia,” Don Jr wrote. He further defiantly tweeted an article from a Russian outlet, ZeroHedge: “Emails Reveal Bill Clinton Met With Vladimir Putin Just Before Uranium One Deal”.The identical article was tweeted by Corey Lewandowski, who authorized Carter Page’s trip to Russia: “Can you imagine the MSM outrage if this was a meeting by a Trump person?”It is highly likely that these tweets were centrally co-ordinated. Exclusive: Trey Gowdy Donor PAC Linked to Russia’s Hack of AmericaExclusive: FISA Target SVB Bank Server Sent Cambridge Analytica Data to TrumpExclusive: Sources: Paul Manafort’s Secret Florida Storage FacilityFun With FISA; The Trump Russia Treason TimelineThe Curious Case of the March for Truth And The Bulgarian HackerPIMPOTUS – Trump Models and Russia’s Human Traffickers"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d864db6510aa000b71e"},"text":"Social media and its use by American traitors working for Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is suddenly a hot topic in the mainstream media.Here I present a short report that is not based on sources, but rather on open-source intelligence, or OSINT, that readers may verify for themselves with links I shall provide in the text. This is offered as a raw intelligence report and I cannot draw a definite conclusion from the facts I report here, other than to suggest it is worth a look by investigators into social media efforts to influence American conversation online.There appears to be an odd commonality among various ‘Resistance’ groups that ostensibly oppose Donald Trump, and do not admit to being linked to each other.There also appears to be a commonality between at least one node on this graph, and websites owned and run by General Mike Flynn, who, along with his son, is being investigated for treason with Russia.The common factor in these cases is that, at one time or another, websites registered by these various entities appear to have shared hosting by a very obscure provider located in Bulgaria.The second commonality is that sites owned by an admin connected to General Mike Flynn’s company, and ‘Resistance’ sites, shared hosting by a particular block run out of Wasilla, Alaska, and owned by Level 3 Communications, an internet giant.Despite the fact that Level 3 Communications is indeed a giant provider, the specific block located in Wasilla, Alaska, on which the ‘Resistance’ and Flynn-linked websites were both hosted, was very small, and hosted a mere handful of sites.I will also report on the reaction from ostensibly anti-Trump persons and accounts to my questions over these shared hosting links.This blog exclusively broke the news both that Wikileaks had obtained Russian servers a week before the release of the DNC’s emails, and that Julian Assange had provided the SSL keys to Wikileaks to that company, Hostkey, run by the Russian hacker and spammer Peter Chayanov.I asked the author of the first piece, Laurelai Bailey, a data scientist, to make her work understandable to a general audience and not to include too many technical details. She and I were nonetheless bombarded by friends of Russia online looking to rubbish her entirely accurate work.This blog also exclusively broke the news, again, in a piece by Laurelai Bailey, that Sean Spicer had tweeted out what most people would think of as a bitcoin password. The technical term is, I am told, “identity confirmation code”, but again, I asked Laurelai to use simple terms non-techies would get. Her (entirely correct) work again brought on a lot of abuse.One man that brought himself to my attention was Christopher Bouzy, on Twitter. He wrote a rebuttal piece, and tweeted a lot of demonstrably wrong denials, such as “You cannot wash money through a botnet” [sic].I was surprised by Mr. Bouzy’s vehemence and started to look at his Twitter account and thereafter the registrations on his websites.One of Mr. Bouzy’s websites, since deleted, was hosted with a Bulgarian hacker, Marian Marinov. The site was called ‘Bycdns. com’.I was struck to find that ostensibly ‘Resistance’ websites, which by rights should have no connection with each other, had also used this provider as a host at one time or another.The fake Twitter account @RoguePotusStaff had pushed a website listed by ‘March for Truth’, a verified Twitter account.Rogue POTUS was fond of slamming James Comey while saying ‘POTUS is winning’ and pushing a coordinated line of despair about America and the Trump Russia investigation.The website was ‘TellYourReps .com’. (I am not providing direct links to the websites as I fear they may carry malware.)Now this site, Tell Your Reps. com, was also hosted by the identical Bulgarian provider. Rather suspiciously, it was being promoted by a troll Russian account that had previously promoted Tulsi Gabbard’s support of Assad, and the website was registered on June 24th, 2016 the date of the Trump-Russia second Treasonmeeting in Scotland, where, we have reported, Russia and Trump did the deal to undermine America’s elections and voting system in exchange for help with hacking.Finally, a third website that ought to have no connection to Mr. Bouzy or to ‘March for Truth’ wound up on this provider as well. WhoWhatWhy dot com, the site founded by the anti-Bush conspiracy theorist Russ Baker, was at one time also hosted by Mr. Marinov’s company.Mr. Baker has connections to Russia, having appeared on RT.com, the channel run by Russian intelligence, who have recently registered under FARA.WhoWhatWhy is, therefore, a strange bedfellow, ostensibly, for the ‘March For Truth’ and that in turn is a strange bedfellow for Mr. Bouzy.Malware Dropping IPsLastly, I note that many of the IPs on which each of these sites have been hosted are listed as malware droppers.As Patribotics has exclusively reported, General Mike Flynn is under investigation for co-ordinating Russia’s attack on the entire West through social media.As we have also exclusively reported, the Kelhios botnet was run out of command and control servers operating from Trump Hotels, and Peter Levashov, the indicted hacker, was paid by Team Trump.Now I can report a further link between all three of these. It is a server out of Wasilla, Alaska, run by Level 3 Communications, a giant provider. The host itself is however discrete, and fairly small, with 256 addresses in that specific block.General Flynn was on the advisory board of a paid group ‘The Intelligence Community’. It featured Naveed Jamali, my source for my FISA story, as an ‘OSINT Analyst’. One of the sites it owned and registered was “OSINT maps dot com“. This site was hosted  on Level 3’s Wasilla, Alaska server.I am told that this IP address was “being used as a command and control server for known malware”. Thank you General Flynn!2. Mr. Bouzy’s website, Charmzi dot com, was hosted there:This *former* IP of Charmzi is, I am told, presently acting up:  “8.5.1.33 is participating in malicious activity, and is confirmed to be hosting exploit code, malware, trojans, spyware and other malicious tools”.3. Dante Jimenez, who is listed as running  Russian botnets on Spamhaus, had a website that was hosted there: Now, as Mr. Jimenez is listed by Spamhaus as the fourth worst spammer in the world today, this may be thought to be quite the coincidence. A sub speciality of his is “providing hosting to Russian drug botnet spammers”.I draw no firm conclusions but note the odd coincidence. One thing that does raise alarms, though, is Mr. Bouzy’s reaction when I asked him about his hosting, both with Marian Marinov and with Level 3 in Wasilla.I asked him:He replied:A twitter ally of mine then asked him:Mr. Bouzy replied:Naturally I was rather interested to learn that Mr. Bouzy claimed to have emailed journalists to coordinate smears on me and my work. I shall be exploring this claim with the organizations and my lawyers once Trump is indicted. I do not know if he was telling the truth about the pieces he claimed to have organized, but his claims included articles, which he helpfully counted out for me, in the week of May 21st. These included the Australian, Salon, Business Insider, Mediaite, and others. Mr. Bouzy had threatened me on May 17th with the ominous threat “winter is coming” which he was good enough to repeat to me on this occasion:Despite Bouzy’s threats to repeat this smear campaign in the press and his repeated statements that “Winter is coming”I have nonetheless reported on his hosting arrangements, which appear to me to merit further scrutiny.Mr. Bouzy was right in one regard. I did indeed persist, mostly because everything I have reported, including the Bitcoin/Spicer article Bouzy jumped in to attack, is true."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d864db6510aa000b71f"},"text":"Sources with links to the justice department report that Fox News is under an FBI counterintelligence investigation for co-ordinating with the Kremlin in broadcasting propaganda.While the First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and journalistic freedom, sources say that signals intelligence gathered from so-called ‘incidental collection,’ such as NSA collection on Sputnik and Russia Today,  which is ongoing.Specifically, Sean Hannity is on signals intelligence co-ordinating his pro-Trump message with organs of the Russian state, such as RT, Sputnik, Wikileaks and Julian Assange. However, emails co-ordinating messaging with registered agents of the Russian state are said to exist from more shows than that of Sean Hannity.Furthermore, sources familiar with the matter say that the FBI is actively considering a referral to the FCC, in addition to any criminal prosecutions that may result for individuals not registering under FARA for coordinating with official agents of the Russian state.A great many of Fox News’ employees, anchors and executives have reported fearlessly on Trump and Russia, including Shep Smith. The problems appear to be executive based and systemic, these sources say, and a referral to the FCC is being considered. The First Amendment protects journalistic freedom, but systemic and repeated coordination with official organs of the Russian state is regarded as knowing collaboration with an enemy attack on America. Referral to the FCC is an option under consideration at a corporate level, sources report, and prosecutions for chief malicious actors, in particular Sean Hannity, are probable, these sources say."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d864db6510aa000b720"},"text":"In the wake of the Washington Post’s naturally, and commendably, guarded exclusive on Vladimir Putin’s direct ordering of the Russian attack on Secretary Hillary Clinton, we offer readers a short guide to what sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one Western nation and sources with links to the Justice Department report that allied nations possess in terms of SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence, on various suspects in the Russian hack of America.This guide is intended to be a report on what we know and is not exhaustive. Doubtless there is a lot more out there from allied and enemy nations to the West that we do not know of.Countless intelligence agencies, mostly hostile, hacked Trump’s insecure Android phone. The British, Ukranians and Germans all have recordings of Carter Page in Moscow offering treason for hacking, and recordings of Page playing the tape of Donald Trump for his Moscow paymasters, wherein Trump promises unspecificed (to us) shifts of policy in exchange for hacking help.As I reported exclusively at Patribotics, this tape was discussed with Sergei Kislyak by Trump, Manafort, Page and Epshteyn. As I further reported, Sergei Kislyak’s phone was ‘hot miked’ through an SS7 exploit by a Five Eyes nation for a portion of last year. By request, I am withholding the nation and the amount of time that Kislyak’s phone was recording all those with whom he came in contact*.  I will report on exactly how each nation holds this intelligence when I come to Carter Page.The United Kingdom in particular has a treasure trove of intelligence on Donald Trump. Before Nigel Farage – acting as a courier, sources say – went in to see Julian Assange, Donald Trump called his phone (the previous night). British intelligence taped that conversation, sources say, as Farage was under surveillance, and have provided the resulting fresh evidence of treason to the USIC.Julian Assange’s conversations about Trump and with his couriers are all on tape. British intelligence and the NSA have been inside the Ecuadorean Embassy for some time. There is disbelief, sources report, in many conversations between the two closest intelligence partners in the world, America and Britain, at how stupid the Russians and Ecuadoreans have been to believe Julian Assange’s pitiable assertions that his communications were ever secure.Vladimir Putin, for the avoidance of doubt, was recorded by both British intelligence and private allied intelligence firms of more than one nation, directly ordering an attack on the United States election and on Hillary Clinton. This recording was given to the Washington Post, and they held it back out of respect for US intelligence, for which I applaud them.Donald Trump Jr was directly taped by the French before the election, colluding treacherously with the Russians. As with all NATO allies who are not part of the Five Eyes agreement, there is no legal reason why they cannot directly tape Americans abroad. The FBI would need permission with a FISA warrant to listen to any such intelligence on U.S. persons.The SIGINT on Eric Trump is mostly held by the United States. Eric, who is not loved by his father nearly as much as his sister Ivanka, has been left holding the baby on the Kelhios botnet. As his father tries to scrub Ivanka from Trump holding companies like TIHM, he has left Eric in place. The Kelhios botnet was delivered from Trump Tower by a command and control center activated by Eric Trump.However, the United Kingdom also holds SIGINT on Eric Trump, because it had ears on the Alfa Bank boardroom, and Eric’s communications with Alfa Bank washed through the server in Trump Tower and the Spectrum Health server were intercepted by the NSA – as all the packet data was – but the UK owned the phones, computers and boardrooms on the Russian end, so has ‘written’ SIGINT on Eric Trump.Ivanka Trump is on tape with multiple unnamed allied intelligence services over her fraudulent hotel in Baku, sources report. She is on tape talking to her traitor husband Jared about the hack on America. Most significantly and recently Australia has Ivanka Trump on tape talking treason with the Chinese, who allied with Russia in its attempt to hack America. Australian intelligence and the great nation of Australia herself were grossly insulted by Bannon and Schiller when Nick Warner, the head of Australia’s ASD, their CIA equivalent, underwent a cavity search at the US border on a diplomatic passport. Trump deliberately leaked his insults to the Australian PM on an early diplomatic call. Australia is taking a quiet delight in knowing that they have the most damning evidence against Trump’s disgustingly preferred child Ivanka Trump, whom, sources say, is not “complicit” in standing by for treason and criminality but is an active participant in it.The SIGINT on Mike Pence, and there is a lot of it, is held mainly by the USIC. I will write an article separately later detailing the case on Pence. Russia holds extensive kompromat on Pence, having hacked his emails to keep him in line. Mike Pence is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Moscow.Again, SIGINT on Ryan is the near-exclusive preserve of the USIC and RIS (Russian Intelligence Services).Almost exclusively American intelligence on McConnell, with, among enemy nations, Iran and Russia both having a good deal of their own. A separate article follows.SIGINT on Gowdy is extensive from the USIC but also Great Britain, in that Britain still gathers intelligence in her overseas territories like the British Virgin Islands. A separate piece follows.Portugal’s intelligence service has had Devin Nunes on tape for quite some time. He is a loathsome traitor and long-time colluder with Russia. When Nunes ran to the White House in the dead of night it is because he saw his own name legally unmasked in those transcripts. Nunes would love to make a deal but the FBI is not interested.As I exclusively reported, Flynn, who is as delusional as he is dishonorable, was taped by almost every European intelligence service. Great Britain has extraordinary amounts of SIGINT on Flynn, as it has been gathering intel on the Russian spy ring at Cambridge for some years now. Flynn’s role in the Russian hack is under-appreciated. He is one of the greatest traitors in American history, and his treason far pre-dates the present lunatic operation of Vladimir Putin.One consideration motivating Flynn’s extensive squealing to the USIC – he has no more loyalty to his fellow criminals than he had to the United States – is his desire to spare the life of his son Mike Jr. The younger Flynn, currently under investigation for espionage, traveled with his father to Russia for RT, coordinated with Sputnik operatives like Cassandra Fairbanks in the US, and pushed RIS propaganda and malware. He was taped in Russia by Great Britain as part of MI6’s wholescale ownership of all Kremlin comms – that is to say that the UK listened to the remote and local mikes on any Russian with whom Flynn jr was conversing – but most SIGINT on Flynn Jr is held in America.Mostly held by the USA and Russia. Bannon has been a Russian asset of medium significance for at least five years.Sergei Kislyak was under surveillance by the NSA throughout 2016.  The NSA has SIGINT on Reince Priebus resulting from this, that is extensive, and now in possession of the FBI.However, in terms of foreign allies, Saudi Arabia has recent SIGINT on Reince Priebus. According to our impeccable sources, Mr. Priebus decided to ‘run’ when in Saudi Arabia. He panicked when he learned on Air Force One what the SIGINT gained from surveillance of Kislyak at the RNC amounted to. I exclusively reported there was a RICO case against the entire GOP as a body; this is because they accepted, via Reince Priebus, washed Russian money, sources say. The way in which this was to be laundered was recorded at the RNC, sources say. Saudi Arabian intelligence picked up a voice recording of a panicked Mr. Priebus, fresh off the plane, claiming he would seek asylum, sources say. He was under a UFAP warrant, sources with links to the U.S. Marshals report, and was immediately brought back to America under compulsion by Air Marshals who had been placed on Air Force One, these sources say, less than 24 hours later.Mr. Priebus’s quick return was covered by a passive mainstream media who did no investigating into why he was brought home. I knew why Priebus had returned but withheld that report at the request of sources with links to non-US intelligence. I have now been granted permission and even encouraged to report everything relating to allied intelligence on Trump Russian suspects.This report will be updated with a Part II tomorrow.More of our exclusive reporting:"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d864db6510aa000b721"},"text":"New financial disclosures reported by Donald Trump show Ivanka Trump’s name being scrubbed from shell companies related to online gambling. Sources with links to the intelligence community and separate sources with links to the White House say that these companies were designed to disguise Russian payments and money-laundering. They further point, these sources say, to the fact that the Kelhios botnet – which was used in Russia’s hack on the American election – was run by a command and control server working from Trump Tower, with the full knowledge of Eric Trump.Ivanka has been linked to eleven companies in the Trump financial disclosures. Her status has been put to “Inactive” on several odd holding companies, including:and others. The most immediately interesting company of Ivanka Trump’s is “Poker Venture Managing Member Corp“.  This is owned by Donald and Ivanka Trump. Ivanka’s company with her father itself is an officer of this very dodgy-looking shell, “Poker Venture LLC.” Judging by the corporation wiki, there is panic in Team Ivanka and Team Trump over “Poker Venture“.  It shows zero “Key People”, and has two other almost identical companies as its officers – the live, active PVMMC that Ivanka co-owns with her pops, and this “Inactive” attempt to clean Ivanka out of the picture: by: Poker Venture Managing Member Corp by: Donald J. Trump.Those touring “Corporation Wiki” will be surprised to see that “Poker Venture Managing Member Corp by: Donald J Trump” lists itself as an officer of inactive “Poker Venture”, yet when one clicks on the gray icon, one is taken to the same active company.All very strange. Why are Ms. Trump’s shell companies having a panic? What does it matter if she is directly connected to Trump International Hotel Management (which she is) through TIHM? Why is “Poker Ventures” suddenly showing as both active and inactive simultaneously?Sources with links to the intelligence community say that the disassociation with the TIHM is because Trump Hotels and Eric Trump are linked to the Kelhios botnet, which was run with a command and control server out of Trump Tower with the full knowledge of Eric and Donald Trump, and also of course, of Ivanka Trump, whose husband Jared was talking to the Russian Ambassador in the Russian Embassy about secret communications with Russia.Poker Venture Managing Member Corp is a Nevada company. On the Nevada Secretary of State’s website, it shows an odd filing history. The company was formed in 2012, filed an annual listing in 2013 and 2014; no documents are listed for 2015, but two appear two years later, on August 4 2016.  However, the official Nevada listing shows PVMMC being cancelled on May 22, 2017.Equally odd is that the state of New Jersey   – (Ivanka Trump has a New Jersey address listed as one of her business records, associated with Poker Ventures) – has added to its newly published list of “Internet Gaming Ancillary Companies”  both Poker Ventures LLC, which was already listed, but also “Novacorp Net Ltd”, “VidMob Inc” and “Reblaze Technologies”.  VidMob Inc, a video company, appears to have a Russian developer on its github, Sergey Shpuntov, whose activity appears to be locked on GitHub; Novacorp Net appears to be associated with a credit card company whose records have been scrubbed (but not well enough); while Reblaze Technologies appears to be coded by Russo-Israelis. Much worse, Reblaze Technologies does not appear to have much to do with “ancillary services for internet gambling” in NJ – rather, it publishes anti-NSA blogs such as these, lauding the ‘hacking tools’ leaked by Shadow Brokers. Reblaze also offers lists of “protect your website” services you can buy from Russian hackers [sic], listing, ostensibly to protect against them, the full range of tools employed on Russia’s hack of America; its founder repeated the anti-NSA blog in an article that reads as a threat to hack America on Medium in December 2016.Put all of these together – Novacorp, VidMob and Reblaze, as brand new additions to New Jersey’s “ancillary internet gambling companies” and you see three Russian companies involved, sources allege, with the Kelhios botnet, the direct Russian hack on American voter registries and the DNC, and malware delivered via the Kelhios botnet, that are now trying to cover themselves by pretending to have something to do with “online gambling”. Sources suggest that all three directly relate to Ivanka Trump’s “Poker Ventures” company with her father, which is listed on the same sheet. The state document says:It is not therefore much of a leap to imagine – though sources were not specific on this point – that Novacorp, VidMob and Reblaze have been discovered to have been paid by a Trump company, and that their late additions to the New Jersey filing are an attempt to provide a figleaf over other “services” that they did provide.On the wider reason for the cover-up on Ivanka, sources suggested patribotics was being pointed to specific documents because Trump is threatening to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Patience for Trump’s obstruction is wearing thin, sources with links to the intelligence community report. They also suggest that Paul Ryan, who is more realistic towards his own predicament than Mr. Trump, is willing to cooperate with authorities in exchange for mitigation of his own sentence. If Ryan gives up McConnell, and does not impede Mueller or the FBI further, it is possible he may avoid jail, although like Devin Nunes he will be required to resign from Congress. Ryan spoke in defense of Special Counsel Mueller, showing that Trump can no longer rely on Russian kompromat on Ryan to protect him. Read More of our ground-breaking Trump Russia journalism here:"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d864db6510aa000b722"},"text":"James Comey is about to lay the smack down on Donald Trump. But it is important that patriotic Americans have an understanding of what may happen at a select committee hearing – given the appalling level of misunderstanding of Admiral Rodgers testimony yesterday.James Comey has clearly described obstruction of justice. He has described in terms Trump asking him to back off the Flynn investigation and demanding loyalty.James Comey doesnt say “obstruction of justice” so it didn’t happen.In the hearing, do not expect James Comey to say ‘obstruction of justice’ happened. That is a judgement call.Comey’s testimony letter shifts tenses. It states that at first Trump was not under investigation. However it also clearly says that Comey fully anticipated that this might change, and warned Trump against it. The shifting tenses of the past in the later parts of the memo imply that Trump was under investigation by the time he was dismissed.The Trump camp is trying to lie and spin that Comey early on saying that Trump himself was not under investigation at the start of his interactions means that he is not being investigated now, or that he will not be. This is a plain lie.In the hearing, do not expect Director Comey to breach any classified protocols which would include stating that Trump is under investigation.Hell no, he did not. He GLOMARed a message on National Security. Rogers is NSA – like Coats, his function is NATIONAL SECURITY.  Trump could not have “obstructed justice” by leaning on Rogers, but would have interfered with a national security investigation. This matter is, itself, a matter of National Security.ONLY the FBI has a twin intelligence and law enforcement function. Obstruction of justice is inherent in Trump’s intervention with James Comey only.Trumpers were stupid enough to think that Rogers covered for Trump. He went silent on him like a submarine slipping behind the baffles of its quarry. As senior NSA John Schindler wrote in an exclusive, Rogers has issued an unprecedented ‘preserve evidence’ order and has held town halls at the NSA describing election hacking.James Comey is, as I wrote in January, America’s white knight. He is a master chess player. He is not interested in Twitter plaudits. He will not give away anything on an ongoing criminal and national security investigation. He will describe facts – HOW Trump obstructed justice – and not make characterizations – “Trump obstructed justice”.Nothing can stop the impeachment of Donald Trump that is presently ongoing. Comey is here today to stop the lies of Trump and his White House flunkies."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d874db6510aa000b723"},"text":"On October 15th the FISC, or secret intelligence court, granted a FISA warrant against two Russian banks – Silicon Valley Bank and Alfa Bank. (That is, as I have reported subsequently, two warrants, one per bank,  granted on the same day.)Milo Yiannopoulos has an account at one of these banks. He told me this himself.  I reproduce the string of our email correspondence below. Milo Yiannopoulos, the provocateur journalist, and I, were once friendly. And then, due to the alt-right and his support for it, we were not. We were, however, still civil.Before the recent revelations of Yiannopoulos position on child abuse, he had both a book deal, of some consequence, and was doing a tour of colleges. At Heat Street, we often covered the early stages of that tour, where liberal students would try to deny the conservative provocateur a platform by shouting him down. I was and am in favor of free speech.However, in the period just before and after the election, those normal “student” protests suddenly became violent. And yet nobody could find the so-called “students” who were causing violent trouble. I started to suspect that Russian ‘active measures’ were involved in funding these riots. The independent journalist Caroline @RVAwonk has a number of good threads on twitter about how Russian-Trump linked provocateurs like Baked Alaska will travel to places like Berkeley, looking to cause trouble.However, I did not pursue this line of thought as I had other, bigger, fish to fry.There was one thing on Twitter that caught my notice, however. A woman was complaining to me that she had done work for Milo and not been paid. He had a bad record in the UK of not paying women journalists and then threatening them. I asked him on her behalf whether her claims were true. This was on background, so I am not reporting it. Rather I am excerpting here the separate parts of our email conversation where I asked him why he had an account with Silicon Valley Bank – a name familiar to me from my own FISA exclusive of Nov 7th.I asked:On that matter, he replied:We then exchanged further emails on the topic that was on background. But I returned to the issue of the bank account, which stuck out for me:He said:He then gave me an “on the record” quote that was a smear against the complainant. But as far as I am concerned, everything not relating to the matter he emailed me on was and is on the record.I did not write a story of any kind about his feud with the complainant. He sent me an on-record smear against her, including a swipe at her disability, but the rest was on background.Milo had previously boasted to me of his friendship with Peter Thiel (which may, I must point out, be complete rubbish – he is an unreliable witness who lies) and with Robert Mercer.Sources did not say why SVB Bank was under a FISA warrant. They were more forthcoming about Alfa Bank. They did however describe SVB as ‘a Russian Bank’. Most posts on the matter are from Russian sites that track readers, so I link to this Daily Kos description of the agreement between SVB and Sberbank in 2012:There will be more on SVB’s role with Jared Kushner shortly."}

CNN – while wrongfully claiming an exclusive on both Taylor’s original news breaking and the first mainstream reporter to cover the news, Keith Olbermann – nonetheless confirmed last night, Tuesday, May 9th, that subpoenas were issued from the Eastern District of Virginia against associates of General Flynn.Senator Markey announced on CNN that a Grand Jury had been empaneled in New York and cited this blog. I referred to a probably linked document from the Southern District of New York in my last piece, which reported as fact that no fewer than six separate FISA warrants had been issued in the Trump-Russia probe, but I am able to report tonight as fact both that my own sources, who are independent of Mr. Taylor’s sources, confirm multiple sealed indictments delivered at State Grand Jury level in the Southern District of  New York, and that intelligence sources also believe that the first arrests in Trump Russia will shortly be announced and may come as quickly as tomorrow.For the sake of clarity, I still cannot report anything further than a probability on the linking of a civil document in the New York case to the indictments that have been obtained in New York under RICO. People familiar with the matter speculate that General Flynn may be among the first people arrested but they do not confirm the news.Lastly, I can report hilarity at memos distributed throughout the intelligence community warning national security patriots against “leaks”. The confirmed and illegal leaks to the press in the Trump Russia scandal have come from Donald Trump, Mike Pence, Mike Flynn, Mike Pompeo, head of the CIA, who, sources say, is greatly distrusted because he chose to leak to the press at the behest of Sean Spicer, along with Senator Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Devin Nunes, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.None of Trump, Pompeo, Pence, Nunes or Burr, each and every one of them a confirmed illegal and political leaker, has faced the slightest legal consequences** for leaking classified information.**So far. Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d874db6510aa000b726"},"text":"UPDATED: Boris Epshteyn has denied some parts of this story, which I report within the text. Sources with links to the intelligence community say it is believed that Carter Page went to Moscow in early July carrying with him a pre-recorded tape of Donald Trump offering to change American policy if he were to be elected, to make it more favorable to Putin. In exchange, Page was authorized directly by Trump to request the help of the Russian government in hacking the election.On November 7th I reported that the FBI had been granted a FISA warrant to investigate the activities of two Russian banks, Alfa Bank and Silicoln Valley Bank. I also reported that an earlier attempt to obtain a FISA warrant, in June, had failed in the court because it named Donald Trump himself and three of his associates. In an exclusive at Patribotics, I reported that these named associates were Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Boris Epshteyn.Sources close to the intelligence community now report that this application was made because a recording exists of all three men discussing the possibility of Page taking the tape of Trump to Moscow as an earnest of good faith. (Update: Mr. Epshteyn has denied he is on any such recording, but I am not sure if he is denying the conversation took place and have asked his lawyers to clarify). There is a minor dispute over whether Trump himself is also on that tape, as well as the tape that was delivered to Moscow by Carter Page of Trump making this promise. A separate source with links to the intelligence community reported to me several months ago that Boris Epshteyn, alone of the four men named in the first FISA application, is an actual FSB agent (he has strenuously denied this). Paul Manafort is registering as an agent of a foreign power [update: he has yet to do so]; Carter Page has admitted, from public reporting, to have met with Russian intelligence agents.It may therefore be surmised that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, in this conversation wherein they discussed taking the Trump tape to Moscow, were all acting in concert as agents of the Russian state first and foremost, and Trump staffers second. Because the provision of such a tape to Putin would clearly be the ultimate in kompromat on a future American President (far worse than any sexual blackmail tape).The FISC judge, as I reported, rejected that application, made in June. Director Comey likely proved to the satisfaction of the court that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were acting as Russian agents. But he may have felt that Trump, by now the nominee, was just a very stupid patsy. And the planned trip had not taken place.Director Comey redrew this request and presented FISC with a new warrant application. The Washington Post says that there is a FISA warrant on Page, but it does not say that there is NOT a FISA warrant on the other two men named in the June application. I will therefore assume from now on that the July FISA warrant granted targets Page, Manafort and Epshteyn.Page had always seemed weirdly confident about his relationship with Trump. He had the tape of Mr. Trump offering to change policy. Sources say that this tape was played in meetings with Russian intelligence officers in Moscow, and that several Western intelligence sources have recordings of the meetings and the tape which they supplied to US intelligence.The Washington Post does not name the date in July when Director Comey obtained his warrant. It seems likely however that it would not have been before July 5-8, when Page was in Russia. Furthermore, my own story on the separate FISA warrant granted on the two Russian banks states that Director Comey specifically sought permission to examine existing transcripts and intercepts on US persons as they related to this inquiry into money laundering into the Trump campaign.My November 7th report directly connects the granting of the banking warrant to election hacking of the DNC. It is fair to say that, at the time of writing, I did not understand precisely how these two matters were connected. I now know and have reported that the server was washing databases of DNC hacked materials with voter registration materials. It is clear that, if my sources were correct, Director Comey would not have been able to listen to the recording of Mr. Trump played by Mr. Page in the offices of Russian intelligence in Moscow until he obtained that warrant, in October; his July warrant on Page came too late to affect a trip on July 5-7th.When Carter Page returned to the RNC in Cleveland, he and Jeff Sessions, who recruited him to Team Trump via the Alfa Bank lobbyist Richard Burt, both met with the Russian spymaster Sergei Kislyak. From public reporting, we know that they not only changed the RNC platform on Ukraine at the behest of Russia, but also discussed lifting sanctions, a violation of the Logan Act.Mr. Epshteyn was probably also present at that meeting. [Update – Mr. Epshteyn has issued a denial that he is an FSB agent, and has denied “meeting with Russian spymaster” Sergei Kislyak, as I have described the Ambassador. It is unclear to me from the wording of the letter whether he is denying that he ever met with Mr. Kislyak, or that Mr. Kislyak is a spymaster; I am seeking clarification]. The reason I say this is that I can personally report that Mr. Epshteyn, whom I had met several times in the green room at Fox News, and I, had a bet on – I bet him $100 that the Republican Party would not actually nominate the racist and sexist Donald Trump.I lost that bet and made a point of texting Mr. Epshteyn at the conference to pay up. He was charming. I handed over the $100. He went back to Mr. Trump’s private suite.I now realize that I was probably giving money directly to an agent of Russia (at Mr. Epshteyn’s request, I have changed this from “an FSB agent”. Mr. Epshteyn has not yet  clarified for me if he is an agent of Russia under FARA, so I am altering the text pending his answer). But if I could not hear what Mr. Page, Mr. Manafort, and Mr. Kislyak were discussing with the Russian Ambassador behind the door of Donald Trump’s suite, the FBI most certainly could.I will produce a short timeline of the Trump-Russia story on this blog tomorrow. For now, the point is that intelligence sources say that Page, Manafort and Epshteyn, possibly also with Trump, are on tape discussing how Page should carry a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, offering his bona fides in exchange for Russia’s help hacking the election (something that Epshteyn denies, specifically, he denies that he is on tape doing so – I have sought clarification as to whether the conversation happened, and will amend the text when I receive an answer); and that the said tape of Trump was played by Page to Russian intelligence, possibly including Mr. Diveykin, the Russian official in charge of hacking the election; and that multiple foreign intelligence services, among them the UK, Germany and Ukraine, have a tape of this; and that finally, in October, the FBI was able to listen to that tape.So God bless America, and God Save the Queen."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d874db6510aa000b727"},"text":"On November 7th, I reported at Heat Street that the FBI had obtained a FISA warrant covering the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia.I reported that the FISA warrant had been granted after an earlier, failed application to the court in the summer named Trump and “at least three other men, who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates”.Those names, sources said, were Donald Trump, with Paul Manafort and Carter Page (two men that had formed part of Trump’s campaign) and Boris Epshteyn, who at the time I reported, the eve of the election itself, had only acted as Mr. Trump’s media surrogate.Since that time, Mr. Epshteyn has become a part of government as a Transition Team official and now at the White House and I feel able to be explicit as to the names sources gave me as forming part of the summer application to the court.It is important to note that the application to FISC made by the FBI in June* was denied. The FBI must, by definition, have represented to the FISA court that they believed Trump, Page, Manafort and Epshteyn were either actual Russian agents, or Russian “agents of influence”, which can be unwitting, as Brad C Moss, a national security lawyer, pointed out in my report for Heat Street.The application that was successful, in October, named two Russian banks – rather than US persons suspected by the FBI to be agents of influence for a foreign power – as it targets- and was drawn more tightly under the ‘minimization’ doctrine around money laundering and financial offenses, I reported. But, the FISA warrant explicitly granted the FBI permission to examine the communications of U.S. persons as they related to this money laundering inquiry. I did not report any “wiretapping” of Trump tower, nor any surveillance; rather, my reporting faithfully reflected the views of my sources that a warrant was granted.Indeed, rather than any concept of new surveillance, I reported that the FBI had sought permission to examine already existing evidence, provided to the CIA or NSA by allied intelligence services, that related to this inquiry – specifically, to the money laundering inquiry. They previously had been unable to listen to this evidence, or to read these intercepts, because they involved “U.S. persons”. Contrary to the Trump-Bannon bleating about “deep state”, sources indicated that Director Comey was most concerned to follow the law very precisely; “in order that the chain of evidence have a clear basis in a warrant”, as I said at the time.Two months later Paul Wood of the BBC published a seminal report on the entire Russian war on American democracy, which included further exclusive details on the FISA warrant, which added to my own reporting and made the picture much clearer.The existing evidence, he reported, was a tape made by a Baltic state’s intelligence service, of Russian money going into the Trump campaign. It was made in April, and involved a US person or persons. Wood exclusively reported a six-agency task force including the US treasury was set up to investigate this. (He also reported a second failed application to FISC in August, something I did not learn from my sources at the time, but which sources have since confirmed to be accurate). Therefore, ‘money laundering’ it may be, but ‘from Russia into the Trump campaign’ is the second part of that puzzle, and explains, we may postulate, why Comey described to Congress his national security investigation as including any criminal aspects. It is why the warrant against the Russian banks was sought in a FISC and not an ordinary court.As had I exclusively reported on November 7th, the case was both criminal and a top-level national security case.Exposing new and unreported evidence in such a case as (I believe) both Trump and Nunes have done is itself a crime.Wood did not specify, but I believe it to be a fair inference, that one of those US persons was Paul Manafort, who took over the Trump campaign in March, just before the tape was made in April. Carter Page wrote to the FBI demanding they stop investigating him; leaving only Mr. Epshteyn as the unreported name in the failed applications.I cannot confirm whether Mr. Epshteyn is, as has been speculated about, ‘Source E’ in the Steele dossier, but he fits the description given of that source. What I can report is that sources stated Epshteyn was named to the FISA court in June* as a target, but – and I re-emphasize this point – that application was denied by the court.Knowing the above, his departure from the White House after two epic failures by Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is not, I believe, a coincidence. Mr. Epshteyn has not been indicted (as far as I know) still less convicted of any crime. But it seems fairly obvious to me that Nunes is obstructing justice in plain sight –  and should be arrested.When Nunes said:I do not believe that was a slip of the tongue. I believe he referred to Mr. Epshteyn and tipped him off on live television.Further, Mr. Nunes’ rants about FISA warrants (plural – I have only reported one, more, clearly, may exist) ought not to be assumed to be fact free. Instead, they should be assumed to be a completely illegal and garbled recitation of classified information illegally acquired and distributed by Nunes. When he says what he read “did not relate to Russia” he means he read details of a money-laundering investigation under FISA (but it did relate to Russia). When Nunes says he “did not hear the word Russia” nor would he need to if he were illegally reading transcripts of conversations involving money laundering, names and amounts. And when he refers to a member “of the Presidential transition team” on which he himself sat, I believe he is referring to Boris Epshteyn.Mr. Epshteyn has, again, not even been indicted, far less convicted in any court. But IF he is indeed under a top secret investigation and his buddy and Trump lackey Nunes has just discussed both the evidence against him and the fact that he is under investigation, then it is Representative Nunes who needs to be arrested. The House Intelligence Committee should do more than demand that Speaker Ryan remove Devin Nunes as chairman of the Russian hacking inquiry. It should call Nunes as a witness, under oath. Having sat myself on a Select Committee, I know very well that politicians become friends with their opposite numbers. It is hard indeed to turn on a colleague with whom one is friendly. But the Committee must steel themselves to their manifest duty. Removal of Mr. Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is now a matter of the national security of the United States at the highest level.More of our exclusive Trump-Russia journalism:"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d884db6510aa000b728"},"text":"Jeff Sessions has just been confirmed. It is now incumbent on patriotic Republicans and Democrats, and, failing that, patriotic lawyers willing to bring cases, to demand that Sessions recuse himself from any and all investigations concerning Russian hacking of the election, the Department of Justice investigation into corruption and election interference by the FBI field office in New York and the NYPD, and any investigations involving Steve Bannon or Trump or Breitbart campaign staff, past or present.Even those who are only loosely following the Russian hacking story must be aware of the names of Carter Page and Paul Manafort, and of the FISA warrant, which Ii reported was issued to the FBI’s counter-intelligence division in Connecticut on October 15, 2016, concerning the activity of the server in Trump Tower and of two Russian-linked banks, Alfa Bank and SVB (Silicon Valley Bank).Jeff Sessions was first announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘National Security Adviser’. He was next announced by the Trump campaign as its ‘Foreign Policy Adviser.’ Senator Sessions has no experience in either of these areas of policy.On March 16th, then Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told Newsmax that Jeff Sessions, personally, was putting together Trump’s foreign policy team.On March 21st, the Washington Post reported its interview with Trump in which he states that this list of foreign policy advisers includes Carter Page. The transcript is not perfectly accurate. If one listens to the audio recording at the top of the article, however, Trump says: ‘Give me the list, Corey [Lewandowski], so I can be a little more accurate here.’ He then reads the names from a piece of paper, explaining the odd cadence (as written) of ‘Carter Page, PhD,’ which is not how one normally announces the name of a team member, but does reflect how Page might be described on a written list.This detail suggests that Trump himself knew little of Page. Miller is on the record as saying that Jeff Sessions is putting the team together.Carter Page had absolutely no, zero, foreign policy experience. This odd choice was remarked upon at the time.Senator Sessions must explain why he chose Carter Page, who went to Russia in July and reportedly met with Sechin on sanctions and the head of Russian intelligence, Igor Diveykin, charged with hacking America’s election.Politico reported that Carter Page also met Sergei Ivanov, “until recently Putin’s Chief of Staff”.Senator Sessions must answer if he had any input into, or oversight of, Carter Page’s letter to Director Comey of (September), in which Page carefully says:This language is so carefully parsed, that Carter Page could have metCarter Page (in regards to the Alfa Bank server) has or had ‘an office around the corner from Trump Tower’. And these are only the top lines of his suspicious contact and total lack of qualifications, to have been chosen by Sessions.Jeff Sessions must answer for his recruitment of one of the FBI’s top suspects in Russia’s hack on America, believed also to have offered to lift sanctions in exchange for assistance to Trump in the election; and who features in the Steele dossier.Jeff Sessions is deeply connected to Alfa Bank, one of the banks named in the FISA Court’s October warrant. His chief of staff Richard Burt is a lobbyist for Alfa Bank. According to the Steele dossier, Trump was required to switch positions on Ukraine in exchange for intelligence. This happened in April, according to the dossier.April is when Paul Manafort joined the campaign as its manager.April 17 is when Richard Burt, Alfa Bank lobbyist and Jeff Sessions chief of staff, wrote a Trump speech that did just what the Steele dossier requested Trump do. http://www.newsmax.com/Headline/Trump-Campaign-Denies-Ties-Russia/2016/10/07/id/752155/Nor did it stop there. Alfa Bank’s Mr. Burt, whom, like Carter Page, the Trump camp tried to wash its hands of, denying contact, continued to advise Jeff Sessions during the summer and wrote policy papers for him. Newsmax reports:But Mr. Burt was in the direct pay of Alfa Bank. Sessions must name that intermediary.Sessions is directly responsible then for three of the most crucial things in any criminal, intelligence or Congressional investigation Russian hacking of the election: the recruitment of Carter Page, Trump’s shift in foreign policy towards Ukraine and Russia, directly matching the time and the substance as reported in the Steele dossier to be ‘payment’ for Russian hacking, and for deep connections to Alfa Bank, on which the FBI FISA warrant was finally granted. He would be both a suspect, and a key witness. Jeff Sessions as Attorney General would be in the position of prosecuting, or not, Yvgeny Nikulin, the Russian hacker who connects Russia’s attack on America and the sedition of the FBI Field Office in New York.Elements within the NYPD and the FBI Field Office in New York are suspected of criminal conspiracy with Donald Trump and his electoral team, including, but not limited to, the National Security Adviser General Mike Flynn, Rudy Giuliani, and Lara Trump, the wife of Eric Trump.  Before the release of Director Comey’s election-altering letter, which was wrongfully, perhaps criminally, leaked by Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the following people had boasted in advance that the FBI Field Office in New York and the NYPD were leaking to them about “criminal inquiries” into both Wiener and the Clinton Foundation, and that they had “a surprise” coming, which would alter the political course of the election:General Mike Flynn, National Security AdviserRudy Giuliani, legally advising the PresidentLara Trumpand others.Mr. Nikulin was picked up on October 5th in Prague on an FBI Red Warrant. That is exceptionally serious. He has still not been extradited. His indictment, issued October 21, states that he ‘transmitted a code’ to a computer and mentions that he hacked, with admin credentials, LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring.Formspring is the application Anthony Wiener first used for sexting. It closed altogether in 2014There is clearly every likelihood that Nikulin “woke” Anthony Wiener’s old computer and activated or planted copies of emails upon it. The DoJ indictment states thatDid you get that?“Nikulin is alleged to have engaged in a conspiracy with unnamed co-conspirators to traffic stolen Formspring user credentials”That means a Russian hacker traded credentials of Anthony Wiener, to whom?The indictment further states:My theory, to be explicit, is that Russian hackers, working with and for the Trump campaign, handed over Anthony Weiner’s sexting credentials; that emails were planted on his computer: that the FBI and NYPD elements in New York (Field Office) boasted to the Trump camp they had an “October Surprise” coming: and they forced Director Comey to reveal his private letter.Is Jeff Sessions going to bring home to America this accused criminal, Nikulin, taken in Prague on an ultra-serious Interpol Red Notice, when Nikulin could indict all his friends and colleagues on the Trump campaign?Will Congress and those Republicans who trust Sessions force him to do this?Will Sessions try to dismiss the extradition of the hackers Comey has picked up abroad? Will he try to prevent deep prosecution of Nikulin? Will he tread on the extant six-agency taskforce, or refuse to recuse himself, a suspect, in Russian hacking?It is saddening to me that patriot Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham are voting yes on Jeff Sessions because they know him, when Sessions, for deniability, refused to read the Russian hacking report.They should limit his power as AG – or lawyers with conflict of interest specialities should go to the courts to remove him.Patribotics hopes to expand reporting and commission other writers.

When Jason Chaffetz illegally revealed the letter James Comey had sent to the heads of the House and Senate intelligence committees, removing the ‘classified’ markings from the portion he tweeted out to the world, Gowdy wrote:It is in that noble spirit that Patribotics presents this report.Trey Gowdy’s main donors are connected directly to Cambridge Analytica, the data company that targeted the US election, washing their Facebook and Twitter targeting with the stolen DNC Vertica database and with state voter rolls that were hacked. They also appear to be connected to direct funding of Democratic voter suppression and to the Kelhios botnet, which I have reported was both sent from command and control servers operating from Trump hotels, and was paid for by Boris Epshteyn on behalf of both Russia and Trump.Mr. Gowdy’s funding also connects the Russian hack and the RICO case on the GOP as a body neatly together.Gowdy’s main donors for the last two years include Great America PAC, which paid for “online voter contact” to various organizations. These include Media Bridge LLC, World Net Daily and Campaign Solutions:Media Bridge LLC is, per its website, run by Shane Cory. He also takes responsibility for ‘Renew America PAC’ on Twitter. It hosts Liberty News Now dot com, which has in the past been hosted on what is a known “Command and Control” malware server.Renew America PAC is ultimately run by the former Republican Senator Alfonse D’Amato, who defended Russian hacking of the election and attacked the intelligence community in an article in December:Mr. Backer’s firm, according to the UK’s Telegraph, specializes in taking foreign contributions and hiding them:Great America PAC also spent on Campaign Solutions and on WorldNetDaily for “Online Voter Contact”.World Net Daily is a fake news pusher. The FBI investigated, on Election Day, for links to Russia, accounts and individuals pushing fake news about the election.Campaign Solutions worked with Cambridge Analytica when placing targeted ads on behalf of John Bolton; these are Robert Mercer supported entities. Cambridge Analytica is under FBI investigation and the SVB server, which sent its targeting to the Trump Server, was, we report, the subject of a FISA warrant obtained by James Comey on Oct 15, 2016. According to Ad Age, Campaign Solutions began working with this major target of Mueller’s inquiry as far back as 2014:Furthermore, Trey Gowdy did not merely get a donation from a group that spent on Campaign Solutions. His main contributor, per the FEC, is from his “E Donation 5 Account”. The image of the form shows their mailing address, 117 North St. Asaph St,  is the same as that of Campaign Solutions.Thus, we can say that Trey Gowdy is directly receiving donations from PACs working with the Russian hackers of the US election. Whether Media Bridge LLC – the apparent boss Mr. Cory follows Roger Stone, Russia’s RT.com and Wikileaks on Twitter, and at the time of writing he only follows 153 accounts –is connected to “Media Bridge United” and “EU Mediabridge”, both registered at the identical P.O. Box as Hostkey, the Russian Wikileaks hosts, remains to be seen, but doubtless Mr. Mueller will have questions.  IP registered to these domains pumped out fake news videos laden with malware."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d884db6510aa000b72a"},"text":"Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Donald Trump is being investigated for trafficking underage girls into the United States for sexual abuse, under the guise of his shell modeling company, Trump Models.These sources report that Trump is linked to a Russian-based human trafficking enterprise, where girls and women were kidnapped into sexual slavery. This includes underage girls and minors.The human trafficking arrests made recently in Europe, and several human trafficking cases in the United States, are linked to the same paedophile ring, these sources say.Furthermore, the sex trafficking of girls and underage children is linked to the Russian government via the same internet data that links Hostkey, the Russian hackers of the American election, with Mir Telemakti. They all share a registrant address in the British Virgin Islands.Sources report that this nominal internet services provider, Dragonara Alliance, is in fact a mere intranet, over which Russian organized crime sponsored by Vladimir Putin discusses the kidnap and rape of girls. Dragonara Alliance was traced back to various IP addresses shared by Hostkey and Mir Telemakti. An intranet needs publicly to exist, these sources say, as an IP provider, in order that its existence not cause questions. But the NSA is deep inside Dragonara Alliance’s servers, and can read their packet data. It provided material assistance to Europol and Interpol in making recent arrests, these sources say.Mr. Trump’s company, Trump Models, recently locked its account on Twitter. It has been listed as paying women slave wages, and Trump has been accused of bringing in girls illegally,  making them work without visas for nothing and housing them 11 to a room. Despite the scrutiny, Trump Models has deleted its Instagram account. Sources report Trump cannot provide accounts showing Trump Models was ever a legitimate business. There are multiple public reports that the agency forced girls to work for slave wages. The Daily Beast’s Michael Gross also reported that Donald Trump personally pimped out underage girls from parties at his own hotels. For this, Trump, and his children Don Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump, all part of Trump International Hotels management, may be held liable, sources say.Further, sources report that Smart jet Aviation LTD, which uses SmartJet.ru and Jetorama.com, is an aviation company used to ferry trafficked females around. Smart Jet purchased a lot of fuel and acts as a broker for private flights. Again, sloppy opsec had the company registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey in the British Virgin Islands. The Smart Jet Aviation registrants use a type of trolling familiar to the student of the Trump-Russia “PO Box 3469” address, the use of a Russian scientist as a pseudonym for the registrant. However, they were dumb enough to use an email address connected with “bizarrebrain.com” where they forgot to take the real name of the registrant, one Damir Valiullin, off the site. Damir links in the Panama Papers to Dennis Kolyago, who is a senior executive with a regional Russian fuel company.  This may explain all Smart Jet Aviation’s purchases of airline fuel for human trafficking.JetSmarter, a company linked to Donald Trump and the Russian mob, used to be called Smart Jets Inc in the United States, but it is not known if it is the same company as “Smart Jet Aviation.”JetSmarter maintains it is a legitimate business. Sources say it is under counterintelligence investigation for Russian mob activity. Its former CEO , Edward Barsky, was a mobster who has invested in Sunny Isles, Florida.And it is directly linked to Donald Trump through both Barsky and Mike Flynn and Ron Torossian. Researcher Louise Neu showed on Twitter that Torossian was a spokesman for Michael Cohen’s partner, and also wrote the pro-Turkey op-ed attributed to Mike Flynn. Torossian was forced to amend his FARA earlier this year.Dmitry Sorokin, the current COO of Smart Jet Aviation, is also listed on LinkedIn as the head of Red Square Holding. Red Square Realty is linked to Donald Trump’s own Miami properties and to the Russian mob, as we have previously reported.Mr. Trump’s PACs also accepted funding from companies linked directly to the Smart Jet Aviation and Hostkey P.O. Box. Is it a coincidence that Smart Jet Aviation, registered to the same PO Box as Hostkey, hackers of the Russian election, and Jet Smarter, BOTH share investors with Donald Trump’s properties in Miami, Florida? Is it also a coincidence that JetSmarter used to be called “Smart Jets” in America?Possibly so. The company declined to comment. But what is definite is that Smart Jet Aviation is being investigated for human trafficking with Dragonara Alliance used for the communications; and Donald Trump is being investigated for human trafficking with Trump Models. JetSmarter is under investigation for Russian mob ties, and Smart Jet for trafficking girls into misery, rape and death. Industrialized child abuse has been carried out on behalf of Vladimir Putin. And for Donald Trump himself, a locked Twitter and deleted Instagram are not going to save him."}

Multiple recordings and transcripts exist. At least one set of these is in the hands of British intelligence at GCHQ.It is presumed but not known for certain, therefore, that US intelligence would already have these recordings.The Five Eyes agreement prohibits the United Kingdom both from surveilling Americans without judicial permission from the US and from conducting surveillance operations on American soil.

This excludes Boris Epshteyn, who although he is an FSB agent and a long-term Russian asset, these sources say, is also a U.S. citizen.  Mr. Epshteyn, through lawyers, has adamantly denied that he is an FSB agent and has demanded Patribotics remove reporting on him. Although I have updated my stories to reflect his denials, I stand by my reporting. Mr. Epshteyn’s lawyers declined, in writing, to say whether or not he had been advised by the FBI or law enforcement to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, instead asking me who my sources were and when I received my information from them, questions to which I in turn have refused to respond.The resulting recordings form a complete record of the meeting. If, as must be assumed, British intelligence has passed them to their American counterparts, the evidence would be fully legal as any Americans on tape would be “incidental collection” to the targeting of the Russian spies Kushner, Trump Jr and Epshteyn met with in order to commit espionage against the integrity of a US election with a foreign power."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d884db6510aa000b72c"},"text":"In order not to slow the narrative of this report, I have put an important caveat at the bottom of this story concerning both the innocence of the real adult woman whose name Russia used in these profiles, who was almost 17 when Weiner’s crime was committed, and the presumably separate then 15 year old girl in the New York case whose name is sealed. I have no firm intelligence on the identity of Weiner’s 15 year old victim.On May 18th, an Air Force One Group Gulfstream GV landed at Charlotte, North Carolina. This is the kind of plane that normally transports Cabinet members. It is not known who was on the plane.On May 20th, Anthony Weiner pled to a count of sexting with a girl who had not obtained 16 years old at the time of the offense.On May 22nd, the Hill reprinted a story from WhoWhatWhy.com to following effect:I broke the story that Anthony Weiner was certainly sexting with a person or persons other than a 15 year old girl in ‘The Carolina Conspiracy’ in early March. A source close to Who What Why contacted me and stated that the girl in their report was the same person I had covered in my own reporting. Their report stated:My source told reported that this court document, which the site did not publish, was a traffic citation. When I put that to the owner of WhoWhatWhy, a conspiracy theorist who is anti the Bush family, Russ Baker, he stated he did not know what I was talking about.But because the Hill reprinted the Who What Why story, I had begun to seek details myself. Everything else referred to in their report, such as faked social media profiles on the girl, I had already independently obtained in February and March. I held it back from my reporting only because I could not find an official document on which to rely.I now have such a document and present this report on the intensive faked social media personae created over one “Miranda Crowley”. As I state below, I have no evidence other than the assertion of my source that the then 15 year old girl in the sealed court case in New York is named Miranda Crowley. It certainly could be an entirely different victim. That victim of Weiner’s must be different, for she is, the SDNY prosecutors assert, underage and the case is sealed.Miranda Crowley, the real woman, is an adult of 18 years old, having attained her majority this spring.  When the sexting with Anthony Weiner began, in January of 2016, she was 16, over the age of consent in North Carolina. In March she turned 17, which is the legal age of consent in New York. Either, then, Anthony Weiner’s victim is a different person, a child, or the plea bargain is seriously awry. I make no assertions on the law; Weiner stipulates he thought he was sexting with an underage girl of 15 years which itself constitutes a crime, so clearly this is not about exculpating Weiner or blaming his victim. The question would be why is the plea deal false, stating that the victim was underage in North Carolina at the time of the offense? And what significance, if indeed there is any, is there to a Cabinet level Air Force One Group GV landing in North Carolina just before the plea deal was struck?The story is not about the 15 year old victim of Weiner, nor about the real Miranda Crowley, but rather, about the concerted, provable Russian effort to ‘catfish’ Weiner with fakes and force the Comey letter which handed the election to Trump. Fake profiles, by definition, are just that. A letter full of passages from obscure adult books was written by adults. Russian-linked operatives and agents of influence boasted that adult males had carried out that hack on behalf of Russia. It is these fakes that this report addresses, and therefore, the accusations are leveled at a group of adult males and not the real young woman whose identity they stole and faked.Before the election, innumerable social media profiles featuring the pictures of different girls were set up by hackers and social engineers in the name of “Miranda Crowley” showing a sophisticated effort to set up a completely fake person online with a hinterland of friends and relatives who also proved to be fake. There were Twitter, Facebook and Ask.FM profiles. I spent weeks clicking through the friends lists on these public profiles to find relatives who also proved to be fakes. Some few examples of my voluminous list of “Miranda Crowley” accounts are here, here, here, and here. A fake account was set up on Facebook in the name of “her” “father” “Matthew Crowley” who worked as “U.S. Airways Training Center”. Click through to that august institution, however, and you came to this page (I was nothing if not thorough).Before Alanna Goodman wrote her story, one @Annierrobbins published, one month before, a tweet hinting at the Weiner hack. “Confide” was the app Weiner used to sext his victim.Subsequently, just after the James Comey letter was written, Kirstin Winfree claimed it was not a 15 year old girl that Weiner was sexting with but a “28 year old Bernie voting hacker.”She added “Who thought the Russians could play a sweet southern girl from Northern Carolina so well!” #Checkmate #HillarysEmail”That does seem pretty suspicious, especially since Ms. Winfree has social media profiles with the name “Logan” in them, Crowley’s middle name. She is a huge partisan of Putin and Russia:and regularly tweets out Russian propaganda sites like RT.com.More importantly during the Comey letter period, Winfree was tweeting out propaganda created by Jack Posobiec, the Russian agent of influence who supports Trump. She was also in contact with Posobiec   and the Russian hacker 0 hour, zero hour.Posobiec, who was employed by Rebel Media, openly admitted to his role in accessing and publishing hacked “Macron Leak” emails.At the time of the Carolina Letter, he was boasting of knowledge of the corrupt FBI investigators.Posobiec certainly seemed to think at the time that Comey was forced into reopening the investigation. He boasted of NSA traitors who had hacked the DNC and Podesta emails and gave them to Assange. He cited Guliani, who was boasting of active FBI agents demanding this, and boasted of FBI sources himself.Interestingly, Posobiec tweets first about Wiener in 2013. He is also now linking Erik Prince of Blackstone to the case. Sources with links to the intelligence community have suggested to me that Prince and Oleg Deripaska may both be involved in the social media operation around “Miranda Crowley”.Mr. Deripaska owns Endeavor, the PR agency, and one Mr. Adam Waldman was registered under FARA as an agent for him at one time. A “warning” which I print here as delivered to me, and which I regard as a threat, was sent to me about this specific story.Mr. Deripaska had been said by some sources to be connected to the Daily Mail story on the ’15 year old girl’. I put that in scare quotes not because I assert the girl in the New York case, the victim, is not the age that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York say that she is, but because the girl in the story did not write the email to Weiner that they claimed.Further, the real Miranda Crowley is 18 years old. Her traffic citation has been published on a public crimebusters website. This may or may not be a reliable source. However, I have in my possession from sources close to the matter, an official document from the Secretary of State in North Carolina, relating to her voter registration, which matches the age of 18 found on that alleged copy of her traffic citation.The many fake Miranda Crowleys, often laden with references to CWA the hacking crew, are almost certainly as Ms. Winfree said the creations of Russians and nothing to do with the real young woman in question here.The interesting thing about the “AnnieRRobbins” account is its connection to the first time Mr. Weiner was sexting and was hacked. The New York Times reported in 2011 that fake twitter accounts were used to catfish Weiner back then.At that time, a fake account looking like nothing so much as a modern Putinbot, Dan Wolfe, was also tweeting out hints.I have asked Michael Anton of the White House if he, formerly of Breitbart, was “Annie R Robbins”. The account is linked to a bitter blog about Ms. Robbins, a liberal Jewish personality, by one “Apollo Speaks”. As “Publius”, Mr. Anton wrote extensively at Breitbart about Anthony Weiner during his first fall from grace. I very much suspect Anton of having repeated his obnoxious pattern here; fake accounts, Latin aliases, cowardly anonymous attacks, and first hand knowledge of a hack on Weiner. He has declined to reply to my email thus far.My first blog on this story, ‘the Carolina Conspiracy’, lists the pseudo-intellectual tripe of obscure books that the “15 year old girl” put into “her” email to Anthony Weiner. It does not fit any young teen but does fit Mr. Anton’s fifth-rate pseudo-intellectualism. I await his comment.I will report further, in later articlesm on the role of CWA, the hacking crew of persona management experts, about Mr. Nikulin, the Russian hacker who was picked up in Prague on a charge of hacking Formspring, Anthony Weiner’s old sexting app, and other persons who may have played a part in it. I will also add further links and screenshots to the evidence listed in this story.In March I published ‘The Carolina Conspiracy’, a piece asserting my theory that Anthony Wiener was ‘sexting’ with Russian hackers and not with a 15 year old girl.Following Wiener’s plea deal to one count of the charges laid against him in the Southern District of New York, I appended a correction to that piece, and this correction, for the moment, still stands. Weiner pled guilty to a charge that did amount to ‘sexting’ with a 15 year old girl. The name of that girl is sealed because according to the charge, she is a minor.At the moment, I must stress that I have no evidence before me to prove that the underage girl in the sealed complaint is the same person as the one on whom I am about to report.The woman whose real name was used for the fake media profiles in this story is “Miranda Crowley”. She was almost 17 during the three months Weiner’s crime was committed, so, at present, I must assume that the 15 year old girl to which the New York court case refers is another person.Further, nothing in this report is intended to suggest that the real young adult whose name was used by Russian hackers in this operation. Clearly the premise of the story is that fake social media profiles were used by adult Russian hackers. None of this open source material on the fake “Miranda Crowleys” is to be attributed to Miranda Crowley, the real person."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d894db6510aa000b72d"},"text":"EXCLUSIVE: Sources with links to the Justice Department confirm that U.S. intelligence has legal copies of all Donald Trump’s “tapes” of his meetings with Director Comey – and that Comey had his own phone legally hacked in order to record suspects, including Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, for over a year.On June 9th, in the United States District Court of the Eastern District of New York, Judge Orenstein slapped down Jeff Sessions as he attempted to force the service provider on James Comey’s phone to assist Sessions with continuing an SS7 exploit placed there by the consent of James Comey, and lawfully, in order to help Comey in his criminal investigation of Donald Trump and Russia.Separate sources with links to the intelligence and justice communities are clear that the ‘witness’ in this case is James Comey, the ‘software solution’ is the SS7 exploit used on his phone by consent, and that his phone was recording, again, by consent, and as part of a lawful criminal investigation that included Donald Trump, all his conversations for well over a year. This would mean that the FBI had essentially used Director Comey’s cell phone to monitor suspects in the Trump Russia case since before the beginning of June, 2016. This is very, very bad news for Mr. Trump.  If Trump, as he is openly threatening, prepares to fire Special Counsel Mueller, parts of these tapes may be leaked to the general public. The court case itself, with the names of the witness and his cell phone provider redacted, is open, public record, but sources linked to the intelligence community have confirmed the witness to be Director Comey, giving the document an extraordinary significance.First we can see that the ‘hot mike’ phone was provided to Director Comey by Federal Agents, in or before the summer of 2016, as part of a criminal investigation, and in order to assist him in that investigation:Second, we can see that Director Comey had renewed his written consent on this ‘several months later’ and again just two days before Trump fired him. The day after this consent was renewed, Comey interviewed Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump about the Kelhios botnet operating out of Trump Tower, which they both had knowledge of.  This conversation too was legally recorded and likely was the immediate spur for Trump to obstruct justice by firing Comey.It is clear that the government, by which we mean Jeff Sessions, submitted to the court that he needed help finding out how Director Comey’s cell phone had been monitored as the “software based solution” (ie, the SS7 hot mike of the phone) had been discontinued. Intelligence sources familiar with the matter were scornful of the idea that the consensual monitoring of Director Comey’s phone would be continued after he was fired for investigating Trump’s sons and the Kelhios botnet used in Russia’s hack of the U.S. election. (In point of fact, sources laughed aloud at the suggestion).The translation of this passage is that intelligence agents who consensually hacked the phone switched off their exploit the second Trump fired Comey, and Jeff Sessions was whining to the court that he could not get back in.In the dry language of the ruling, judge Orenstein told Sessions that Comey was using this exploit to investigate a crime and that hacking his phone without consent was completely unnecessary. He told Sessions to go and boil his head.The front-facing of Director Comey’s identity to Patribotics may be taken as a warning shot on Mueller. As I have previously reported, Donald Trump is under a criminal indictment, and Director Comey decided he himself might need to be fired in order to advance the narrative away from himself and towards Donald Trump’s criminal actions. Sources report the Articles of Impeachment being considered by the Judiciary Committee have now advanced further and the language of them is presently being worked upon for presentation to Congress, at which point, the criminal indictment granted against Trump will be made public.Come for the Bishop, best not miss."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d894db6510aa000b72e"},"text":"We have New York State Attorney Eric Schneiderman to thank for the genesis of the sealed indictment against Donald Trump currently being held in the Eastern District of Virginia, which has formed the basis of the case of impeachment already begun against him. This is how that happened:AG Schneiderman began a case of Enterprise Corruption, the state name for RICO, against Donald Trump. The case was based on the activities of Russian mobsters like Semion Moglievich who lived in Trump Tower, Russian oligarchs, and others.Upon his own judgement and belief, Scheiderman decided that his case touched both Federal issues, and issues of National Security. He took his case to the Federal authorities. While the appropriate Federal District can often be location-based, if a federal case is to start on the same factual basis, the court chosen can also be based on subject matter. Because National Security is involved, Schneiderman brought his case to FISC to be heard.FISC does not empanel Grand Juries. Per procedure, Schneiderman dismissed his case, which as a state AG he can do without a judge’s ruling; he had the right to dispose of it. The case was then restarted Federal Court on the facts offered by Schneiderman, as a RICO case. FISC provided evidence under seal to a Grand Jury, drawn from the Eastern District of Virginia, who read the evidence in a SCIF, a secure facility in the building sealed away from the public.Sources report FISC retained some jurisdiction over this case, although jurors were empaneled from EDVA. Separate sources report this: it was unclear to me if the FISC power over the case was solely related to sealing the matter, or if perhaps there was more evidence heard at FISC than was shared with the Grand Jury. But that ‘some jurisdiction’ was retained was told me by several sources.Earlier this month, Claude Taylor and I reported exclusively that the indictment was granted. We were pulled up on use of the term “granted”, but it is the correct term when, as in this case, no prosecution is yet possible, since a sitting President has immunity; but he can be indicted, and he has been.We reported as fact that the case was intended by prosecutors to form the basis of impeachment. This too was absolutely correct. Following the granting of the indictment on Trump, DAG Rosenstein took the matter to the Senate and presented it to lawmakers including Lindsey Graham in closed session. That is why Senator Graham came out and said ‘this investigation is now very clearly a criminal one.’ He had to say that; there was an existing criminal indictment and he had been shown it.The following day, Rep. Green called for impeachment on the floor of the House. Contrary to what some ignoramuses are pushing on social media, a case of impeachment was begun against Trump at that moment:Per procedure in the case of impeachment of individuals, the matter then went to the House Judiciary Committee.Trump was then notified by both the other branches that a case of impeachment was commenced against him.  I can report as fact that the Sergeant At Arms of the Senate, Frank Larkin (correction sorry needed tea), went to the White House on that Wednesday night. We did not report that the Marshal of the SCOTUS did so – only that she spoke to him before he left the country, on the matter of preserving evidence and complying with the orders of the courts. Sources linked to the enforcement arm of the judicial branch report Donald Trump was also told that he had not followed procedure to declassify evidence to the Russians; and that it would constitute an offense were he to share intelligence without declassifying it in the legal way on this trip. These sources do not report the location of that warning nor who delivered it to Trump, but it happened after the case of impeachment was begun and prior to his departure on Air Force One.Sources report that AG Schneiderman, whose evidence was used to form the basis of a criminal indictment of the President, has been placed under an even heavier armed guard than usual for his protection.Op-Ed: Imagine There’s No Donald: What if the 45th President Were Orrin Hatch?Naveed Jamali Tweets He Was a Source on the FISA Warrant StoryMilo Yiannopoulus Has An Account With a FISA-Targeted Russian BankEXCLUSIVE: Marshal of the Supreme Court Warned Trump over ‘Muslim Ban’Mike Flynn Turns on Trump, Talks To FBI"}

Gen Mike Flynn has turned on Donald Trump, and has already had at least one lengthy interview with the FBI.General Flynn has not been offered a deal as of yet, these sources say. They indicate that as of this writing Flynn has not been arrested. He would likely be offered a chance to surrender himself, sources report, when that time comes.Sources with links to the Justice Department indicate that General Flynn has already been indicted. On Twitter, Claude Taylor exclusively reported on May 14th that an indictment against Flynn had been returned by a Grand Jury and that this indictment was sealed. I can further report that Flynn’s indictment is thought to be for his failure to register under FARA, the Foreign Agents’ Registration Act, for his lobbying for Turkey. Reporting by NBC of Grand Jury subpoenas in an investigation for which Flynn is the subject, sources say, cover separate offenses of Mike Flynn’s that are linked to Russia. These are being investigated under prosecutors in Northern Virginia*, with an attorney accustomed to handling espionage prosecutions.Sources believe that General Mike “Misha” Flynn, to give him the Russian nickname he awarded himself when picked up by British intelligence committing treason in Cambridge, England, panicked when he heard that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had been appointed to head the investigation into Trump’s collusion with Russia.Mike Flynn may also have interpreted Donald Trump’s text to him, ‘Stay Strong,’ on the day the subpoenas for evidence in the ongoing case against him were announced, as a threat. Sources believe that Flynn informed the FBI, and multiple other persons, of Trump’s text himself.Separate sources with links to the intelligence community confirm our earlier reporting on how Mike Flynn co-ordinated Russia’s propaganda attack on the West on behalf of Trump, giving advice across Europe to far-right parties linked to the Russian state. These include, but are not limited to, UKIP, Marine Le Pen in France and a far-right party in Austria. Flynn regarded himself as a partisan of the Russian state, and his assistance in Russia’s messaging was not limited to hacking the American election, but in trying to boost Nazi ideology and Putin allies right across Europe. These sources state that Gen. Flynn could receive the death penalty for espionage for these activities, if charges are brought on the matter and he is found guilty.Flynn is being decommissioned, sources say, meaning that he is telling the FBI what he knows. This is clearly very bad news for Donald Trump and all those around him who colluded with Russia. It may be particularly bad news for Vice-President Mike Pence, who is attempting, with little success, to disclaim knowledge of Flynn’s collusion with Russia."}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d894db6510aa000b732"},"text":"TL/DR: Server King, Hostkey, and Mir Telemakti are one and the same – fronts for the Russian govt.On October 7th the DHS and the Intelligence Community released a statement on Russian hacking of the election.They stated that:“The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia’s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.”Let us translate: the USIC confirms that Guccifer 2 hacked the DNC emails and was directed by Vladimir Putin to do so.Next, we move on to state voter registration databases:However, happily, I believe I am in a position to do so. Because I can report that sources say that the Russian company which hacked voter registration databases was Hostkey – the host of Wikileaks. King Servers is in fact the same Russian front as Hostkey – both ultimately resolving to, and owned by, the Russian state’s Mir Telemakti.Regular readers of Patribotics will note that we broke two big stories featuring Hostkey, and its owner, a Russian hacker and troll called Pyotr Chayanov.The first is that Wikileaks, one week before their release of the DNC hack emails, acquired two servers in Russia on which to store all their data. The owner of these massive servers was the hacker Pyotr (Peter) Chayanov, head of Hostkey.Upon our publishing that epic exclusive by Laurelai Bailey, @Stuxnetsource on Twitter, Mr. Chayanov deleted his entire account, but not before I screenshot all of it.The second story, even more grave than the first, was that Wikileaks had not merely bought or acquired Russian servers, they had given Chayanov and Hostkey their SSL keys. That in turn meant that Vladimir Putin, Chayanov’s boss, can see the IP of everybody reading anything on Wikileaks and indeed, can see the IP address of anybody who ever donated to Wikileaks.But because Laurelai discovered that Hostkey/Chayanov had the Wikileaks servers, she inadvertently also proved that it was Russia who hacked US voter databases.Because it is the same company and the same server.Furthermore, our most recent exclusive story reported that intelligence sources say the Alfa Bank server was passing voter database info to and from the Russian state, and then handing this info to SCL and Cambridge Analytica (ultimately owned by Alfa Bank) for targeting by the Trump campaign with propaganda.The DNC hack, hosted by Hostkey and Chayanov, would have had access to Vertica, the DNC’s voter registration server. This server had all the DNC’s information on all their voters and where they lived, voting records and so forth. Vertica had the DNC’s voter addresses, campaign modeling and so forth. It was the goldmine. It was everything. It is abundantly clear then that Mr. Chayanov’s Hostkey hackers are Guccifer2; that since Hostkey published the Wikileaks stuff and also hacked US voter state databases, the Alfa server was probably comparing the state rolls with the DNC information; and that this was passed back to the Trump campaign through the Trump server.If the USIC is confident that Guccifer2 was directed by Russia and Putin, then they now know state database hacking was also directed by him, for Hostkey is the same exact company that performed both attacks and then hosted the results.Some sources report that there was also “IP targeting”  for the “dark Facebook posts” shown on users’ feeds (they used VPNs, and saw messages relevant to those VPNs). That could have come about because anybody who read anything on Wikileaks had now handed over their IP address to Vladimir Putin, because his agent, Julian Assange, had given Chayanov the Wikileaks SSL keys.A future post will look at just how SCL (owned ultimately by Alfa Bank) created dark posts to target to Democratic voters and how this is tied right back to Trump.And, ladies and gentlemen, that is the story of how Russian hackers Hostkey, working for Vladimir Putin, in partnership with Donald Trump and his team of traitors, attacked a US election and helped Donald Trump cheat his way into America’s house.Was it good for you?"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8a4db6510aa000b733"},"text":"By Laurelai Bailey Wikileaks has time and time again denied any connections to Russia or the Russian state, but – like Donald Trump – they are lying. This weekend, it was exposed on Twitter that they acquired major Russian servers – from a known hacker – one week before the Podesta emails were released. I will walk you through the proof, since its a little complex for non computer experts. So let’s start with a primer. All websites on the internet have an address, much like houses in the real world. This address are usually names and things you recognize, like google.com or amazon.com. But behind that address there are a series of numbers, unique to each server known as internet protocol addresses. If you have ever had to log in to your wireless router, you wound up typing a number into your browser like 192.168.1.1, this is an IP address. Now IP addresses have physical locations, in the real world, and tools exist to discover where those addresses are. Wikileaks  -like every other website –  has servers and IP addresses behind the domain name “wikileaks.org”.

So we can safely bet that this is when wikileaks added these addresses to their systems. In turn, this proves Wikileaks gained Russian hosting on September 30th 2016, one week before the Podesta emails were made public. Wikileaks got Russian Federation virtual addresses one week before the Podesta emails. Let that sink in. Now the actual owner of the IP addresses is a man by the name of Peter Chayanov, whose IP addresses have hosted spammers and hackers, according to my sources, who work in internet backbone companies.  Chayanov’s IP space is a virtual equivalent of a bad neighborhood that makes you lock your car doors when you drive through it. So this further implies a connection to Wikileaks and Russian hackers. That sort of stuff is Chayanov’s day job. And, further, it’s important to remember, this web host also stays around at the consent of the Russian government despite (or because of?) being known cyber criminal hosts.The other addresses I told you to ignore before? When you do a whois on wikileaks itself you get shown IP’s in Amsterdam and Zurich, ones that make much more sense to have since they are in countries with strong freedom of speech and transparency laws. Places you would want an organization like that in, but the Russian IP spaces, to be visible to you have to be dug for carefully to find them. They did a fairly good job obfuscating it, but the records will always be able to be found.Mr. Chayanov did not disguise his hosting carefully enough. And when he was exposed this weekend on Twitter, he made matters worse by deleting his account at once.So why would Wikileaks, a “transparency” org acquire hosting in a country thats known to assassinate whistleblowers? Especially ones that challenge Trumps presidency? It makes no sense for people who claim to be for transparency to take up virtual residence in an autocratic nation that might try to kill them. So why would they do it? Well, it’s pretty simple; they would only be there with the consent of the Russian government, ieVladimir Putin. He wants them to be there and allows them to be there.  Why would he do that? Sounds an awful lot like putting a rattlesnake in your own bed to keep the neighbors away. That is if wikileaks was as neutral and would leak against anyone like they claim. Putin might be an autocrat, but he isn’t an idiot.  He would not allow them there unless he got something out of it for himself, like immunity to being leaked against or by having influence over what gets leaked and when. Putin like all politicians is a self interested lout and acts in ways that keep him in power. Much like many other world leaders. So wikileaks dropping info on the US alone isn’t enough to allow them to stay, he knows he would be next on the leaking list. So that strongly suggests Russia is getting some kind of favorable or special treatment. Its also likely that the CIA was already aware of this and that this is part of the information they base their claims of Russian interference on. When you see this alone its enough to strongly suggests collusion with the Russian government either directly or indirectly.  So it seems fairly sure to me that Wikileaks is now in bed with the Russian government in some form or fashion. Will we shortly discover that Mr. Chayanov is also connected to Guccifer2? Laurelai Bailey was an original Wikileaks activist."}

CNN concedes that items were recovered from a storage facility owned by Manafort:I had exclusively broken this news on August 5th on Twitter:This was an addendum to my exclusive report, dated May 31, that Mr. Manafort’s apartment had been searched ‘by consent’ at Trump Tower by U.S. Marshals on Friday, 19th June, as soon as Air Force One went wheels-up taking Trump to Saudi Arabia. I reported then that this search found nothing, but, at the request of sources, did not say why.I can now add to my reporting that this was because U.S. Marshals and the FBI knew that Mr. Manafort had transferred these items to a storage space he controls in Florida (journalists should note the location is not reported by WSJ). Sources familiar with the matter report the location was thought to be here:My own research located this facility as Document Storage Systems, Inc, of Juno Beach in Florida.It is important to note that the Wall Street Journal has reported that the FBI had a warrant to read ‘electronically stored communications’ or emails after Manafort “left” the Trump campaign.This reporting tends to confirm my own reporting, namely that agents knew exactly where Manafort was storing paper documents or any electronic items he removed from his apartment. By October 15th, when the FISA warrants on money laundering from the two Russian banks were obtained, which included permission to intercept U.S. persons in relation to the inquiry – Manafort included – the FBI could also hear Mr. Manafort talking.It is important to note that in saying that agents observed Manafort removing items to Florida, my sources did not exclude the possibility of Manafort having more than one storage space for more than one type of item. There may well have been others in Florida and in other states; but this, my sources reported, was one of them. Clearly the building is marked as a ‘document storage’ facility. Sources also said that electronic items, possibly servers, were removed from Mr. Manafort’s apartment in advance of the ‘by consent’ search on May 19th, and that these items were also stashed in a separate storage facility.Some more of our exclusive journalism:Fun With FISA; The Trump Russia Treason Timeline The Curious Case of the March for Truth And The Bulgarian Hacker PIMPOTUS – Trump Models and Russia’s Human Traffickers"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8a4db6510aa000b735"},"text":"Sources with links to the intelligence community and the justice department report that Donald Trump himself is on tape calling in to a meeting at Trump Tower, where collusion with Russians was discussed.Sources could not confirm, however, that the meeting where collusion in the election was discussed was the one at which his son, Donald J Trump Jr, recently admitted to conspiring with Russians to hack the election.They pointed out that there was more than one meeting at Trump Tower where attacking the integrity of the US election was discussed by Trump campaign officials and representatives of the Russian government.The source of the recording of Mr. Trump was his campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman. His phone had been legally hacked by the United States intelligence community under an SS7 exploit and turned into a ‘hot mike’ where he was, unbeknownst to him, recording all those with whom he was speaking.Manafort officially left the Trump campaign in the summer. However, it is important to note that he lived in Trump Tower throughout. He was also working on the campaign throughout.Sources drew attention to the possibility, even the probability,  that Mr. Trump was recorded at more than one meeting committing treason with Russian representatives. For reasons I will discuss in a second article, I believe that Trump called in to a different meeting later in the year in Trump Tower, whether or not he called into, or was present at, the Don Jr meeting.Authority for the FBI to hot-mike Paul Manafort’s phone was granted by the Foreign Intelligence Services Court, which provided two warrants to Director Comey on October 15 for  ‘any US person’ in relation to money laundering and other offenses related to national security granted against Alfa Bank and SVB Bank.Mr. Trump appeared to confirm his knowledge of the bad news of a huge amount of SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence, existing against him on March 3rd. He sent out a string of tweets which themselves were crimes of obstruction of justice, revealing evidence in an ongoing top secret and criminal investigation against the Attorney General Jeff Sessions and members of the Trump campaign as a whole.On that day, Trump tweeted two tweets about Jeff Sessions’ meetings with Ambassador Kislyak and several more alleging that President Obama ‘had my phones tapped’. The media at the time concentrated wholly on Trump’s fallacious accusations against President Obama. This was a reporting failure. The tweets should be read as a whole, relating to what was in Trump’s mind at the time.I found my work on Trump Russia dragged into an enormous spotlight following Mr. Trump’s tweets. Knowing that Mr. Trump had revealed absolutely top-secret evidence and committed a serious crime, obstruction of justice, live on Twitter, the White House sent out my own reporting on the FISA warrant against Alfa Bank and SVB Bank of Nov 7th. I had the bizarre experience of hearing that paragraphs of my report were being read live by Sean Spicer from the White House podium; however, my report at no time made any mention of ‘phones being tapped’ in Trump Tower, still less, that President Obama had ordered this. I was forced to make the rounds of the media to point out that at no time had I suggested Mr. Trump’s phones were tapped. I reported a warrant (below corrected to two warrants) and not what the FBI did with that warrant; nor did I have knowledge of what Director Comey did with his warrant. If Mr. Trump could rely on ‘previous reporting’ for the evidence his tweets revealed, he could avoid an obstruction of justice charge. I was keen to deny that my reporting had ever suggested surveillance on Trump, or on Trump Tower; or that President Obama had ordered it.For reasons I will discuss in a second article, I believe that Donald Trump called in to a different meeting, later in the year, in Trump Tower, whether or not he called into, or was present at, the Don Jr meeting."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8a4db6510aa000b736"},"text":"Sources with links to the justice system in the state of New York report that Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State, is the subject of a major criminal investigation by Eric Schneiderman, the Attorney General of New York.Tillerson is being investigated for financial fraud during his time at Exxon Mobile, these sources say, because he used a fake name, ‘Wayne Tracker’ to attack climate change scientists that were holding Exxon to account. Exxon then said they ‘lost the emails’ in a court filing to New York State.Eric Schneiderman is now far advanced in a criminal case against Tillerson that would involve financial fraud charges related to Exxon’s stock price. Sources specified that personal criminal charges against Tillerson himself, as well as corporate action against Exxon, are actively being pursued.In Nov 2015 Mr. Schneiderman first subpoenaed Exxon; in March 2017, a state judge ordered the company to cooperate.Mr. Tillerson, as Secretary of State, precedes Defense Secretary Mattis in the line of Presidential succession. If tried and convicted, he would not be eligible to serve as President. The same applies to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, who attended the “Scot 24” meeting currently under UK and US investigation for Russian money laundering and collusion.Sources indicated there is a wish to bring any appropriate criminal charges against Tillerson in a timely fashion, should he not agree to a plea, in order that he get nowhere near the Presidency.As reported elsewhere on Patribotics, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah is first in line to the Presidency after Trump, Pence and Ryan, all of whom are under criminal counterintelligence investigation for collusion with Russia. Should Senator Hatch feel that, in a time of crisis, James Mattis would be the best man for the Oval Office, he may choose to step aside. Both Mnuchin and Tillerson would face criminal charges promptly, sources linked to the intelligence community have said, were they not to to be amenable to deals offered them by prosecutors to step aside and allow the smooth transition of power.Criminal charges at the state level against Tillerson would not be pardonable by Donald Trump at the federal level. This is particularly important in the case of Tillerson, as the criminal case against him does not relate to Russia. Trump is indicted at Federal level on a RICO case involving Russia, and may not pardon any co-conspirators as it would amount to self-pardon.His powers of pardon are otherwise untouched, however, and he would have the ability to pardon Mr. Tillerson on financial crimes, not related to Russia, at the Federal level. Mr. Schneiderman has jurisdiction because Exxon does business in New York; the location of many banks in Wall Street, for example, gives Schneiderman power of money laundering that uses accounts in those banks."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8b4db6510aa000b737"},"text":"Donald Trump’s Little Moscow deserves more attention.In 1995, two significant events occurred in Trump’s life, both of which are weighing quite heavily on the nation of late. We learned about the first event in October 2016, barely more than a month away from Election Day. The New York Times published information detailing the $916 million loss Trump took on his 1995 income tax returns in the wake of (primarily) his mismanagement of his Atlantic City casinos.The second event in 1995 is likely a direct result of the first. Trump insulated himself from his own bankruptcies. In fact, he actually made significant profits in the process, but his employees and investors weren’t so lucky. After seeing the damage Trump left in his wake, willing investors and partners in any future business with Trump were hard to find. Trump needed to resuscitate his ailing brand, and the opportunity presented itself in the form of Gil and Michael Dezer who were headquartered in the Miami metropolitan area. Together, the three of them began buying up oceanfront land in the Sunny Isles, Florida. They’ve been building condominiums there ever since.Dezer Development and TrumpWhen asked, Gil Dezer makes sure to put any reporters at ease regarding Dezer Development and Trump’s vetting process regarding the sale of their condos. In 2013, he told The Nation, “We do make sure we know our customer by asking for personal information at the time of signing the contract. We also make sure that anyone buying with an LLC proves to us that they are the rightful owner of that LLC and we check again at closing to make sure that we are still dealing with the same person at the time of delivering title.”However, given Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, it’s worth mentioning that surrounding Trump and Dezer HQ, there’s been a growing Russian physical and monetary presence, especially so after the housing market crashed in 2008. According to Gil Dezer, in 2008 buyers defaulted on 900 Trump apartments, and it wasn’t until 2011 that the Trump buildings began making a profit again. This was made possible largely through their partnership with Elena Baronoff, an Uzbekistani who immigrated from the Soviet Union in the 1980s. She recruited Russian buyers throughout Europe and brought them to Miami to buy Trump and Dezer properties.The extent of Russian money tied to Trump’s Florida propertiesReuters reported in March of 2017 that individuals with Russian passports or address have bought at least $98.4 million worth of property in seven Trump-branded luxury towers in southern Florida. In 2008, the year buyers defaulted on 900 Trump apartments, Dmitry Rybolovlev bought Trump’s home in Palm Beach, Florida for $95 million. Only four years earlier, Trump paid $41 million for the property. Despite this large expenditure, Rybolovlev never lived at the property.An area clouded in secrecyThe problem with trying to understand Rybolovlev’s motives is the same issue we encounter when sifting through Trump’s business dealings and any Russian influence over him—a lack of transparency. No, Trump hasn’t released his tax returns, and no, it is not immediately possible to identify where illegal activity may be occurring. However, the not knowing in and of itself is made possible through a lack of transparency the GOP is more than happy to allow to continue.Money laundering and mob influence has been rampant in southern Florida for decades. Lack of awareness isn’t the issue. The problem is that any attempts to pass legislation curtailing this behavior have been struck down by Republican politicians and lobbyists. This is true whether we’re talking about DC or Florida. Only a few days ago in Washington, House Republicans again rejected a bill forcing Donald Trump to release his tax returns. Turning a blind eye to Trump’s business dealings neither proves or disproves knowledge of guilt by either Trump or those voting against this bill. It simply shows that both the GOP and Trump have a shared understanding. They would rather turn a blind eye to possible corruption or foreign influence, rather than be forced to explain the truth.  Trump’s allies in Florida, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Governor Rick Scott, have taken a similar direction as it relates to possible corruption in southern Florida. We cannot say what they do or do not know. We do know the two have spent $240 million on private lawyers since their time in office began in 2011. We know little details of why such an amount was spent, partly because of Florida’s lax regulations on oversight. Bondia and Scott are not legally required to report this information to the state’s chief legal officer. It’s unsurprising then that they never did so.New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is a man on a missionOn Wednesday, June 7, 2017 the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York arrested Diego Gabisonia and thirty-two other defendants on charges related to a RICO conspiracy. Also this past week, the business partner of Michael Cohen—Trump’s personal attorney since 2006—the “taxi king” Gene Freidman was arrested in New York on tax charges. Schneiderman stated that Freidman failed to pay the state $5 million. As of June 9th, Schneiderman is investigating the Eric Trump Foundation as a result of a recent revelation in Forbes that Eric funneled $100,000 in donations from the charity into revenue for the Trump Organization.Why Diego Gabisonia’s recent arrest may be relevant to TrumpNew York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has a long history of investigating Trump’s various business enterprises. While I’m sure Trump will readily call it all a witch hunt, Schneiderman certainly appears to believe there is something ‘there’ there based on his recent efforts against Trump associates. Was Diego Gabisonia arrested for this very reason? It’s possible, considering his boss, Roman Bokeria, is closely tied to Trump, especially Trump’s Florida investments in “Little Moscow.”The Miami connectionTrump’s initial connection to Russian investors, Elena Baronoff, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2014, and she died a year later. Gil Dezer admitted, “No one has filled her shoes.” However, interested Russian buyers have continued to invest in Trump’s properties in Sunny Isles. At least one person who has attempted to fill Baronoff’s shoes is Roman Bokeria, chief executive of Miami Red Square Realty. Bokeria is the listing agent on Trump-branded condominiums currently for sale in Sunny Isles, Florida (above, left). Red Square has a staff of at least 15 Real Estate Specialists, many of whom are Russian speakers. Diego Gabisonia is one such employee, and he’s now facing charges in New York related to RICO conspiracy and Conspiracy to commit wire fraudTo understand how this all could be related, I must mention another name: Max Slyusarchuk, the President and CEO of A \u0026 D Mortgage. Slyusarchuk’s company describes itself as offering domestic and foreign borrowers with significant down payments an opportunity to benefit from loans that fall outside certain limits set by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. According to their website, A \u0026 D “provides an alternative to our clients to those loans that they couldn’t close somewhere else, yet without have[sic] to resort to hard money loans.” Roman Bokeria’s Miami Red Square Realty is partnered with Max Slyusarchuk’s A \u0026 D Mortgage, seen here:All parties claim to be thorough on their vetting process of new clients, which would be reassuring if there were proof of this, but the evidence is difficult to find. Both companies having associates linked to the Russian mob also throws any claims of legality into question. In addition to Diego Gabisonia, another individual in the area with supposed mob ties is Alex Sorsher. Alex Sorsher is listed as a company officer for hundreds of businesses in the area; one such company is Liberty Tax Service. It appears he acts in many cases as an accountant.The interesting bit is here: Alex Sorsher has been in the past and possibly remains an employee of Max Slyusarchuk at A \u0026 D Mortgage.These hundreds of companies linked to Sorsher often have few company officers and little, if any, actual business activity. They appear to be the types of companies you would setup if you were looking to launder large amounts of money. One such business linked to Sorsher, Eurasia Technology Group Inc, may prove to be the most significant.The importance isn’t necessarily the business itself, as there’s little evidence the company is conducting any, but rather the addresses it has listed. The location given in New York is an office in the Empire State Building, near Trump Tower New York. The second location is Hallandale, Florida, close to the Trump Grande and Dezer Developments in Sunny Isle, Florida. None of the information I’ve presented proves any of these players have committed any crimes, but that’s the defense Trump has used his entire life to avoid conviction. Laws are meant to protect the very fabric of our democracy which Trump appears to be waging war with daily. To put it simply, with more stringent laws, whether or not crimes have taken place would be much easier for either side to prove.As it is, we’re left with an area with a large population of Russian immigrants who have invested in a small strip of land belonging to Donald Trump. The local area, consisting of Broward and Miami-Dade counties, has a long history of mob ties, going all the way back to almost a century ago. Donald Trump campaign associates Roger Stone and Michael Caputo live in Miami. Caputo, in fact, was on a panel in May with Max Slyusarchuk discussing Trump, Russia and sanctions relating to the 2016 election. Is it possible these facts are all unrelated coincidences? Sure, it’s possible, but I think given the magnitude of all this information, the American people deserve to know more. My hope is that my work will lead more citizens and journalists to start looking."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8b4db6510aa000b738"},"text":"Exclusive: Sources with links to the intelligence community now confirm that a tape exists of Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, discussing how Russian money could be funneled without detection to target GOP campaigns, including Ryan’s.These sources report that Mr. Ryan is also on tape discussing how he can best use and disseminate Wikileaks material that was hacked from the DNC by Russia in order to win both his own election and election for Trump.Further, sources say, the tape of Mr. Ryan discussing his knowledge of Russia funding the GOP that has previously been published in the Washington Post is in fact a small fragment of a much more damaging tape.Patribotics exclusively broke the news of that tape  one week before it was released in the mainstream media. In this story of May 11th I reported:A week later Adam Entous at the Washington Post printed his exclusive report on the partial content of that tape.My sources had clarified, at the time, that this tape was not the same as I had heard previously, namely, that Paul Ryan was directly on tape at the GOP convention discussing money laundering with the Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Reince Priebus was on tape doing so, these sources said.Separate sources with links to the intelligence community and justice departments now confirm that there are at least two tapes of Speaker Ryan discussing Russian money, however. One is the tape whose existence I reported and which the Washington Post published. The second, however, is indeed of Ryan speaking with Kislyak at the convention. Sources report that there is signals intelligence, or SIGINT, of Paul Ryan discussing Russian money reaching the GOP and being covered up through companies using the ruling on Citizens United. Further, there is signals intelligence connecting Ryan to discussions on how best to use hacked data from Wikileaks to benefit Trump’s campaign and his own as well as the GOP in general.Sources with links to the intelligence community report a widespread belief that Mr. Ryan is being forced to act sympathetic towards Trump and dismissive of the Russian probe because Russia holds kompromat upon him. There is anger, these sources say, amongst rank and file intelligence agents at Paul Ryan’s gross defense of Trump and rank misstatements of Director Comey’s bombshell testimony. Affirmation that Paul Ryan is on tape discussing Wikileaks and Russian money laundering with Sergei Kislyak at the GOP convention – as well as the extensive further tapes that exist of the Washington Post discussion where Ryan admits knowledge of the conspiracy to wash Russian money – may have been passed on in detail in order to remind the Speaker that if Russia holds kompromat on him so does the United States, and he may wish to reconsider his position before constantly defending treason by Donald Trump."}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8b4db6510aa000b73a"},"text":"Correction: this piece was complete tosh and I can only thank my lucky stars that I put “op-ed” in the title. There is no mechanism to nullify the election of a President who cheated. Luckily, there is a mechanism to impeach him and jail him for it. The “chatter” I spoke of was real chatter, but it was real chatter from patriotic sources who knew of the Russian collusion but who, like me, did not know the law. No Elle Woods smoking jacket for me. This piece is an op-ed. It is not a report. It is based on informed speculation and chatter, but it is not a report, so I’ll keep it short. I wouldn’t call it a theory, either. My theoretical pieces have been analysis of the facts as I saw them. The Carolina Conspiracy, and my piece predicting that Jared Kushner was taped in Trump Tower under the FISA warrant on SVB Bank when talking to Gorkov.In this piece I am going to speculate about something that cannot be proven or even inferred because it has not yet happened and would involve a decision of SCOTUS.The chatter on this matter, and there is chatter, usually says ‘Roberts’ – I talk to more than one source in more than one area – but I am assuming that is shorthand for SCOTUS – goes like this:Chief Justice Roberts has a large amount of evidence before him of widespread fraud in the election. That would include monetary fraud and voter fraud. Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health were laundering data hacked from voter registration databases, as I reported (as a fact) for Trump.The chatter says that in such a scenario, the Supreme Court may invalidate the election of the two men on the ballot: Trump and Pence. Their election would have been invalid. They cheated.As I previously reported, and reported first, Paul Ryan is on tape admitting that he knows Russian money was laundered into the GOP. My piece predated the Washington Post’s piece on the matter by a week. Sources report there is much more to it than was printed in the short section of tape that reached the mainstream press.Therefore, since the line of succession would remain – it was after all Donald Trump and Mike Pence who cheated, not the American voters – the next President, and the 45th President of the United States – the successor to Barack Obama – would be Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.Of course, such a scenario is a dream for many. No pardon powers, no get out of jail free cards, no spot in the records of America’s commanders in chief. As I have said on Twitter, I sometimes wonder if I will wake up one day and see Bobby Ewing walk out of the shower, so weird is our political life since Trump’s election. I have watched the impeachment of Donald Trump, now in progress, at the House Judiciary Committee, and still had the sinking feeling that even if Trump dies in jail (which his reported dementia will likely prevent), his name would still sully the list of American Presidents. There have been bad presidents before – Carter – and even a crooked one – Nixon – but no actual traitors, who would laugh about the firing of an American patriot to Russians, America’s enemy, in the Oval Office. What I truly wanted, and nobody can fault my patriotic ambitions here, was to wipe the Orange Stain clean off the White House. On this blog I have never used the title “President” in front of the words Donald Trump. I don’t think he deserves it. If SCOTUS were to rip the medals off the necks of Trump and Pence, because of their knowing collusion with fraud and espionage – their election would be invalidated, rather than the election. Or maybe the election would be invalidated. I do not know.The waters of the Constitution would be uncharted at that point. Senator Hatch began, I report, as a fact, not a theory, to receive the Presidential Daily Briefing on May 9th. Sources report, again as a fact not a theory, that there is enough to impeach Trump, Pence and Ryan several times over. Even if Trump were to be impeached and removed in the normal way envisioned in the Constitution, my sources report that it will still be President Hatch, and sooner rather than later. They do not, for the sake of clarity, insist that it will absolutely be Hatch right away; were Trump to resign today, Pence would be President; even if impeached or his election later invalidated there would not be time to do it all in 24 hours. However, sources believe it is the intent of the FBI and the Justice Department to move so that there is a smooth transition of power from Trump to Hatch. They do not report how; I assume that evidence would be brought against Pence and Ryan, or even to Pence and Ryan, that would persuade them to resign for consideration of how Justice handles sentencing. But I do not report on that. Only that sources are certain that Hatch will be President.The scenario where Hatch becomes not the 46th, but the 45th, President of the United States, is not reportable as a story. But it is one possible path to justice for America and the world. And on Memorial Day Weekend, when we honor those who have died on our behalf, I think that it is a scenario worth considering."}

However, I stand by my prior and current reporting on this public figure, who, until recently, was a member of the US Government as staff at the White House, as well as maintaining a constant public presence as a surrogate of Mr. Trump’s during the campaign, and on television for the White House after it.Multiple sources with links to the intelligence community report that:Trump Tower was a “command and control” center for the Kehlios botnet, dismantled by the FBI;That the “Trump server” with a Trump Tower IP address, that was communicating with servers owned by Alfa Bank in Russia, and with Spectrum Health, had the data packets it sent opened on the hour by human members of Trump’s data team, located near to Trump Tower;As I have previously reported here at patribotics, the server was ‘washing’ the DNC’s stolen, hacked ‘Vertica” database with voter registration databases – but new sources report further information that images were also sent from or to Russia, and opened by members of Trump’s own team on an hourly basisThat “Pyotr Levashov'” or “Peter Severa”, indicted by the FBI for running the Kehlios botnet, was recruited for the hacking effort by Mr. Epshteyn, who, sources say, was working for both the FSB and team Trump;That in 2015, Trump Hotels was fined a pittance of $50,000 for malware and credit card fraud after it failed to correct an earlier “breach”, but that this was deliberate, as the credit card malware would later be repurposed to be used in the election;That human accounts pushing out fake memes authorized by Russia were paid, via the Kelhios botnet being operated from Trump HQ, using bitcoin and a spam payments system previously used for pornography;And that Pyotr Levashov, aka Peter Severa, is also connected to one Dante Jimenez, another top spammer who himself connects back to Hostkey – the Russian company controlled by Vladimir Putin, with servers in the Russian academy of sciences, that hosts WikileaksSources further attest that the FBI intercepted the traffic between the Alfa Bank server and Mr. Trump’s server, and know exactly what was transmittedSources further report that there were at least two other “mother servers”, other than the one with the Trump Tower IP address, and the Spectrum Health server that simultaneously pinged Alfa Bank. Sources indicate that one of these two servers was at Spectrum Health, and transferred messages to Russia via a method called “iodine xfer transfer”, but that the US intelligence community intercepted all such messagesSources close to the intelligence community indicate that the indictment of Pyotr Levashov in Connecticut this week represents the FBI ‘making its move’ to begin proceedings against Trump and his team, as, these sources say, Trump and many of those working for his campaign are well aware that they are tied by data to the criminal activities of Mr. LevashovMultiple, other sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one country, who were not the original sources on my exclusive story that Carter Page took a recording of Donald Trump to Moscow, confirm that this story is true.There will be extensive further reporting on this exclusive story; please check back for updates."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8c4db6510aa000b73d"},"text":"On March 3rd, Donald Trump made a series of tweets. Three were about a wiretap at Trump Tower. Two, however, were about Jeff Sessions meeting the Russian ambassador. Those tweets got lost in the resulting storm.Over the past week, Devin Nunes obstructed justice on TV, both announcing that one White House staffer was under investigation and that “a transition team member” was recorded in a FISA intercept.As we exclusively reported, that staffer was almost certainly Boris Epshteyn, named by Comey in his first failed FISA application in June.Also as we exclusively reported, Michael Ellis is suspected of having leaked this material to Nunes.But what would be so bad that it would cause Nunes to rush to the White House to illegally receive top-secret FISA evidence?I believe that Jared Kushner is on tape talking to a Russian spy. Worse, I believe that as part of entirely legal and admissible FISA evidence, Donald Trump is also on tape talking to a Russian spy about money laundering.Here is my reasoning. First,the facts. I reported that two Russian banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank, were the subjects, the named targets, of the FISA warrant looking at Russian money being laundered into the Trump campaign. This was a world exclusive on November 7th.Permission was granted for the FBI to look at intercepts that involved US persons as they related to this campaign / money laundering.Boris Epshteyn was named in an earlier version of this case to the court, and the warrant was then denied. But it is not a different case; rather, minimization was applied by the FBI before the warrant was granted.Those are the facts of the matter on the warrant. It is also factually true that Jeff Sessions met with Kislyak, a spy recruiter, and perjured himself over it. It is further factually true that Jared Kushner snuck Kislyak into Trump Tower. Lastly, it is factually true that Jared Kushner met Gorkov, an FSB spy, at the request of Kislyak,Second, informed speculation.I believe that on March 3rd, Michael Ellis, newly placed in the White House, gave Donald Trump some very bad news (illegally). First he told him that Kislayak’s phone calls had been intercepted and his meetings taped – as is normal. Hence Jeff Sessions’ conversations with the spy-master were on tape. Worse, Ellis told Trump, members of Donald Trump’s own family had been taped talking to that same Russian ambassador. Lastly, he, Donald Trump, was also recorded – his phone was recorded – in Trump Tower – talking to Kislyak.Trump would have blustered and demanded to know how this was legal. Ellis would have told him about the FISA warrant. My world exclusive stated this was granted in October, hence Trump’s squeals that “Obama” had him “tapped” “right before the victory”.I believe that here Trump referred to the granting of the warrant as described by Ellis. Ellis may have said, for example, that the Justice Department had to authorize the application to FISC. Trump garbled this because he is galactically stupid.I believe that the references to Trump Tower are because Jared Kushner’s meeting with Gorkov  and Kislyak was indeed taped because SVB Bank is a direct target of the warrant. Epshteyn led an ‘invest in Moscow’ trip in 2014, Gorkov’s bank and SVB had signed a memo to “invest in US startups”. The latter bit is mentioned in the Steele Dossier.As a named target, SVB Bank is legitimate – and US persons caught up in this are legitimate. Jared talking to Gorkov was fair game. Kushner had snuck the Russian ambassador secretly into – Trump Tower. And Trump said “MY phones were tapped.” That means – I believe – that legal FISA intercepts involve not only Jared Kushner talking to Russian spies but also, because Trump called in to this secret meeting or meetings within Trump Tower, Donald J. Trump.Michael Ellis probably called Nunes in with urgency because he saw Trump and Kushner named in intercepts. This explains why the equally galactically stupid and treacherous Nunes said that he read top secret FISA evidence ‘not to do with Russia’ and ‘Russia was never mentioned’. When you are looking at money-laundering and RICO offenses – as I report the FISA warrant was – you do not need to NAME Russia. You discuss dates, amounts of money and deals.But (at the risk of repeating myself) this was indeed a FISA warrant, and was both a national security and criminal case. It was, as I reported in November, not about common or garden oligarch corruption or the Russian mob – it was about Russian money being funneled into the Trump campaign, as Paul Wood of the BBC makes clear in his exclusive report of January 12th.When Ellis saw the actual intercepts involving Trump and Kushner, I postulate, he panicked and rang Nunes for a quiet midnight stroll in the White House grounds – because Trump needed some way to attack the legal and incidental evidence collected under FISA, and “fruit of the poisoned tree” is, quite literally, all these people have left.But the tree is not poisoned, and the fruit is legally top notch.How do you like them apples, Mr. Putin?"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8c4db6510aa000b73e"},"text":"Update: A patriot on Twitter has found another plane, not appearing in the Beauty Central fleet listed online, N789LR, serial number 5100, that made a stop in Belgium in September. She is a GV, with Mode S listed as 52531377When the Steele dossier was published by Buzzfeed, with an entirely appropriate amount of caveats, other journalistic outlets rushed to pour cold water on it, and wrongly so.Chief among these was CNN. Acting as if Buzzfeed had not offered caveats alongside the publication, CNN blasted the news site as though they had irresponsibly published ‘fake news’.In fact, the credibility of Chris Steele was sky-high in the intelligence community, and the heads of all three agencies had included his dossier as an addendum to the Russian hacking report they produced for the President (Obama, at the time; but Trump was also given a version of it).One bit of journalistic malfeasance committed by CNN was that they rubbished the dossier’s claims on Michael Cohen without doing independent journalistic research of their own.Inanely, CNN claimed that they had it “confirmed” that Michael Cohen was not in Prague, Czech Republic, when the dossier said he was.They based this on the fact that, as they claimed, “a different Michael Cohen” had been in Prague around that time, according to a passport stamp. This has nothing to do with the matter one way or the other, and a little thought by CNN would have borne that out. The dossier alleged that Cohen went to Prague and another EU country; that was rated as low confidence as to both location and to exact timing. August, at one point; late August or early September at another point. Furthermore, Steele did not, contrary to CNN’s implication, present location or timing as a fact. It was secondhand; he reported as fact that Kremlin insiders said this, and Steele rated the exact location and timing as low confidence.More interesting was the substance of Steele’s allegations as to why – he reported sources said – Cohen was meeting Russians outside of the US. Firstly, it was to pay off hackers. The dossier made the claim that these were both the hackers who had attacked Clinton, and a company that ran a Twitter botnet (possibly also a Facebook one as I shall later report).I took as my starting point the idea that the Steele dossier should be believed and would be for the most part correct; and that it was more likely to be right than wrong. The reason I took this attitude is that all three heads of US intelligence agencies had included Steele’s dossier as an adjunct to their report to the President.That is utterly extraordinary and represents a massive vote of confidence in Steele’s work. The heads of the FBI, CIA and NSA are not in the habit of including tabloid sensationalism in their official reports, whether as an adjunct or anything else. I do not wish to waste too much time on this, as the report was self-evidently believed to be credible; but contrary to lazy reporting by CNN and others, the dossier was not rubbished by the same agency heads who included it. They said they had not verified the whole of it. That is all. And, again, since parts of the work were not independently verified, its inclusion by the IC represented a colossal vote of confidence in the credibility of Chris Steele (if you are reading this sir please get in touch with me. You are a patriot, may God bless you).Very well then. I posted on Twitter that ‘unverified’ and ‘unverifiable’ are not synonymous and I started looking for ways to verify the dossier. The first clue was that Cohen did not deny it. Rather, he gave fatuous and whataboutery excuses. To Rosie Gray of the Atlantic, Mr. Cohen stated that he had gone to Los Angeles from the 23rd August onwards. He then tweeted:Radar Online is owned by Pecker, of ‘Trump loves Pecker’ fame. The piece tweeted by Cohen, who presumably handed Radar their lines, stated that there was “proof” that Cohen never left the USA in August based on metadata from his Twitter account:The piece also contains video of Cohen on the Sean Hannity show, which is instructional. Cohen says he has never been to Prague and ‘proved’ it to Mr. Trump by showing Mr. Trump his passport. Cohen also points Hannity to the ‘other Michael Cohen’ jumped on by CNN as ‘proof’ that Steele had got it wrong.Cohen therefore wanted us to believe that:a) his social media accounts could prove his whereaboutsb) the second Michael Cohen being in Prague meant that he himself could not also have been in Praguec) The lack of a stamp in his passport proves he could not have left the country.Taking as my starting point that Chris Steele is likely correct, I would treat all of the above as likely true on the face of it, but actually false in implied meaning; so that let us assume yes, a different Michael Cohen was in Prague; let us assume that Michael Cohen’s current passport has no stamp for Prague or out of the country at all in the month of August and September; and that his social media accounts do not have any nice easy ‘Sent from Prague’ or ‘sent from Moscow’ geotagging on them.None of that would, however, disprove the allegations in the Steele dossier, which is the implication behind making those assertions.It is disappointing that American media would treat the one as proving the other. CNN spoke with reverence of a ‘second Michael Cohen’ as if that somehow meant the first one could not have left the United States. A Twitter account I now believe to be a peddler of disinformation tried to feed out the line that Cohen had an Israeli passport with a single day’s difference, explained by the time difference, and that he used this. Now, it is certainly possible that there is only one Michael Cohen who was in Prague on an Israeli passport rather than an American one. But ‘Michael Cohen’ is a common enough name. And the dossier alleged that Cohen was meeting Russian intelligence in order to arrange payment for hackers of the election.It is a fact, indeed, that a Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin, came to Prague to be paid on October 5th and was picked up there by Cezch intelligence on a red warrant from the FBI.How likely is it that a lawyer representing Donald Trump and meeting with Russian intelligence, to pay off hackers that had attacked the US election on behalf of Russia, would have any stamps in his passport of any country? He would be trying for secrecy, and even if Mr. Cohen is a risible fool, as he is, adamantly denying he had ever been to Prague:and then telling the Wall Street Journal that he had been to Prague in 2001; even if, as I say, Mr. Cohen was a bombastic fool, Russian intelligence were not fools, and they would, presumably, take good care to get Mr. Cohen into and out of the United States without any stamp in any passport he might legitimately own; and with no record of exit or entry into the United States.Cohen’s story unraveled immediately, in so far as he contradicted himself to the Wall Street Journal about ‘ever’ going to Prague. But perhaps he forgot, even though Prague is a very lovely city. Being generous, Mr. Cohen is a well-traveled man, who might indeed have forgotten a trip some 15 years ago. However, he made other, stupid slip-ups. He told Rosie Gray at the Atlantic:However, Cohen’s own timeline includes a tweet that shows that on the 24th August he was at Newark airport.I have repeatedly asked Rosie Gray why she has not amended her story to note Cohen’s statement to her is false, but she has not yet responded.Why would Cohen lie about this? He also makes strange statements on how it can be ‘verified’ that he was where he says he was later in the month; calling other people, etc. Frankly all Mr. Cohen would need to do would be to produce some credit card receipts or photographs of himself in the US. He has not done so, according to other journalists also working on substantiating the dossier.Mr. Cohen told the world that we should examine his adult daughter’s instagram account, so I did just that. With the help of various people on Twitter, I was able to get precise dates on some of Ms. Cohen’s pictures.One such picture she posted  showed that she boarded a flight back to the United States on January 2nd. (If it was indeed ever deleted, it is now back online). Prior to that, she had been in St. Bart’s. This was mildly interesting to me since Russians, and particularly Chelsea’s Roman Abramovitch, descend on St. Bart’s every Christmas.The picture was taken from a window seat and showed a distinctive marking on the wingtip. I asked on Twitter if pilots or other aviation professionals could help me identify the plane. Immediately a number came forward to state that it was a Gulfstream, which they could tell by the positioning of the wing flaps relative to the rest of the wing. They further identified the plane as a G5, specifically. Shortly after that, somebody found the plane and found the tail number. It was N999LR.I then researched the ownership of this plane. It was registered to ‘Beauty LLC’. Through ordinary flight trackers I could determine that she had flown from St. Maarten to HPN, a small airport in Westchester. There was quite a bit of diving into ‘Beauty LLC’. At first they appeared to be something to do with Cohen, as they were registered in the same building as some of his companies. But Beauty LLC owned several planes in its fleet. I started to wonder how Mr. Cohen, doubtless a successful lawyer, could be rich enough to own not one but several private jets.The small airport where the jets live, HPN, is next to a ConAir facility and also, I am told, although I have not yet checked this out, one of Donald Trump’s golf courses. It appeared to be more probable that the planes were owned by ConAir and that (although common) the ‘LR’ at the end of the tail number might stand for ‘Leandro Rizutto’, the owner of ConAir.I put this question to Mr. Cohen on Twitter and his reply was most helpful. Showing him a screengrab of his daughter’s  Instagram picture, I asked him how often he flew Mr. Rizutto’s planes out of the country. I also asked Cohen where he was between August 19th and August 22nd. He had given wrongful information to Rosie Gray that he was in LA from the 23rd August, when in fact, his TL showed him tweeting from Newark on the 24th. His timeline on Twitter also geotagged one tweet late on the 19th August and another on the 22nd August. I asked him:Mr. Cohen replied:That was fascinating. I had tagged my tweet #LeandroRizutto and Cohen did not dispute my identification of this plane. Furthermore, his tweet was utterly perplexing to me. He said that his whereabouts “August 19-22” had been verified by the press, but they had not been. His (false) statement to the Atlantic only claimed (wrongly) that he was in LA from the 23rd onwards. He had tweeted from Newark on the 24th. Why would Cohen say that? on August 19th, late, he was tweeting with geolocation from Manhattan, NY (and therefore could not have been in Los Angeles). On the 22nd, again, he is geolocated by a tweet from Manhattan,New York. So he was not “in Los Angeles” nor could “the press” verify something his own Twitter adamantly contradicted.Based on my knowledge of men in general, I would venture to argue that they are creatures of habit. If Mr. Cohen, who in some way seemed to be linked to Beauty Central, had flown Rizutto’s G5 (assuming my guess was correct, and Cohen did not contradict it) back from vaycay in St. Bart’s, was it not probable he’d flown with him before?Planes, too, loomed large in the overall story of the Trump camp’s alleged collusion with Russia. Dimity Rybolovev’s plane had landed for what quite clearly seemed to be tarmac meetings with the Trump camp in Charlotte, NC, on Nov 3; Las Vegas, Nevada; and . Rybolvev’s plane MKATE had also been parked in the Hamptons when the Cohen family appeared to be in residence there.I pulled the flight history for two planes that were still active in the same fleet. N999LR – a G5, the plane that appeared in Mr. Cohen’s daughter’s instagram – showed a curious gap in its flight history in August, all the way through to late September, of which more later.N555LR, the G4, had however flown to the Bahamas on August 19 taking the flight path HPN-FOK-Nassau. She returned August 22nd the same route. This broadly fits the gap in Mr. Cohen’s Twitter timeline, although one tweet shows as being geolocated in Manhattan after the outbound flight. I asked Mr. Cohen if he had been on that flight. He had answered me that he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd, but his Twitter timeline shows he was not. I put this question to him whether he took either flight to or from the Bahamas in that period. He has not responded and later blocked me on Twitter.I do not assert that Mr. Cohen was on that flight. The allegation against him made in the dossier is, however, a legitimate one for journalists to investigate. I believe that the issue of passports and ‘another Michael Cohen’ is a red herring. Mr. Cohen is accused of having met with Russian intelligence, and it is highly likely that were this to be true, the Russians could get him in and out of America without a passport being stamped at all.My theory of how this might have happened is as follows. Mr. Cohen would have taken the flight out, possibly being picked up in West Hampton at the FOK stop. In the Bahamas, he would have disembarked on the tarmac and boarded another plane – rather as MKate arranged tarmac meetings. This plane would have flown him to the EU or to Russia, where he would either have not disembarked at all, meeting somebody on board the plane, or disembarked using fake documents provided by Russia, diplomatic cover, a bribe to a guard at a friendly private airport or any number of other ruses by which a state spying actor could disembark an asset. He would have arranged some kind of payment, as the dossier alleges, and then got back on the plane, landed in Nassau, and taken N555LR back to FOK and/or HPN.Indeed, the limits on this analysis are only bounded by two geolocated tweets from Manhattan on the 19th and 22. Had Mr. Cohen handed his phone to somebody else to place those tweets for him, he could have boarded the plane on the 19th and spent longer in the EU or Russia, returning to Newark airport on the morning of the 24th in order to catch his flight to Los Angeles.I strongly suspect that Mr. Cohen did really have the use of his own phone by the 24th, if only because he made that obvious error in stating that he had been in Los Angeles on the 23rd.Later Mr. Cohen backtracked to me blustering that Newark was an airport and that he had flown Virgin to his daughter in LA – presumably verifiable. But he told Rosie Gray he was in Los Angeles on the 23rd and he asserted to me he was in Los Angeles on 19-22nd. What plane did he take there on the 19th, then? If I were the FBI I would ask that question.Separately to the issue of Mr. Cohen’s whereabouts as asserted vs his Twitter timeline, August 19 – 24th inclusive, I had become interested in the planes of Beauty LLC.Again, I make no assertion that Mr. Cohen did indeed fly to the Bahamas on August 19-22nd on N555LR. But as a journalist, I am interested in exploring the theory of how it might have happened, and if so, what that implied.In the entirely theoretical situation in which this fleet of planes carried Cohen to the first leg of a clandestine meeting with Russian intelligence they would repay looking at.So I looked.What follows owes a great deal to a number of patriotic aviation professionals current and former who assisted me on Twitter and whom I will credit in an update to this article if I receive their permissions.The first thing noted by almost everybody was that there was an improbably large gap in the flight history of the GV, N999LR. This gap covered August and September 2016. Those are, of course, the dates that the Steele dossier alleges there were meetings with the Trump camp and Russia.I make no allegation here of malfeasance on the part of Beauty LLC, its owners, or anybody else. I plan simply to report the unusual facts that I found in public records and to allow intelligence professionals and mainstream media journalists with more resources than I have to investigate whether or not what I report here has a simple and innocuous explanation, which it may well do, or not.The flight histories of all planes in the fleet were made private soon after I started asking public questions about them. That could easily be, of course, simply because private jet owners and charter users prefer privacy. Nonetheless I continued to look.Aircraft are identified by a number of markers. The N-number, which can be changed; the serial number of the aircraft; and the S-code number or number of the transponder.Looking at the current and former fleet of Beauty Central LLC I discovered the three following odd things, which I will the evidence of in a postscript in order to get to the meat of my possibly relevant (and possibly not relevant) discovery:This was sufficient to start tracking every plane in the fleet, current or former. To be clear, as I have said, there may well be an innocent explanation. But it is at the least unusual to have two different aircraft sharing the same transponder S-Code – and for one of those aircraft, the GV, serial number 5031, that became N795BA after being N33LR, to switch transponder numbers between incarnations.Since  I had a gap in August from August 12th on in the G5(s) N999LR, N795BA and N33LR, I chose to look – and was alerted to – the flights of N450GA.Readers who are not already dead from boredom will recall that what was odd about N450GA is that although the N-Number appeared to leave Beauty Central’s fleet, and be assigned to two other companies’ planes with different serial numbers, the S-Code transponder number was always the same. Furthermore, N450GA showed flights in the same period that the GV/s of Beauty Central – N999LR and N795BA – showed no flights.Therefore I will report what trackers showed N450GA did in that period. I make no allegation that Mr. Cohen or Beauty Central had anything to do with these flights, but they are worth investigation based on my reporting about what appears to be unusual data on the registrations of the fleet.On August 12, she flew from Detroit to Halifax. On August 13, from Halifax to Lyon, in France. On August 14th, she flew, according to records, from just outside Florence to just outside Moscow. (There does not appear to be any record of the flight from Lyon to Florence). And on August 15th, she flew from Moscow to remote Wyoming, to Bow National Forest.UPDATE: a pilot tells me the plane did not stop in Wyoming but flew to San Jose:That is, thus far, what my researches have shown. It certainly does not prove Mr. Cohen went to the Bahamas or met with anybody in Moscow. But as he was not where he said he was, and as he is keen to pretend that Twitter data can alone prove whereabouts, I believe that it is worth asking about.When I started talking to Mr. Cohen on Twitter asking about his whereabouts on August 19-22, immediately a bunch of fake Putinbot accounts, some with Ukranian IP addresses, started to @ me. Mr. Cohen would also himself RT these accounts. In particular they started making excuses for Cohen‘s whereabouts. One Russian troll RTed things like this. The dossier alleges that Mr. Cohen paid a company that ran a bot net out of Russia, which infected Democrats and others with viruses. He certainly regularly retweets Putinbots who seem to know him well, and to be directly connected to the Trump administration.  He said to me he would meet me around the first week of March. Others tweeted and instantly deleted that Cohen was at a Chris Christie fundraiser when he said he was in LA.This same Putinbot account tweeted:Under this, there was a gif of Vladimir Putin clapping.If Mr. Cohen comes back to me with a substantive reply on August 19-22 that is not wrong on its face, I will update this post.A few images relating to plane registrations discussed above. More will be added later.N450GA has the transponder 51271263 – serial 4189Now N555LR, Serial number 4189, but a different transponder number: 51611410N999LR, serial number 5481, Mode S Code 53372434N33LR was used as for a GV, 5031, and a G4, 1495But both of these aircraft shared the same transponder number – 50712200 – when they each bore this N-Number.

They forgot state law,’ one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matters discussed.The RICO case – specifically, ‘Enterprise Corruption’, the name given in New York state law, formed the basis of the existing sealed indictment against Donald Trump presently at the Eastern District Court of Virginia. FISC retains some jurisdiction, but what precisely, sources did not specify.The way in which Attorney General Schneiderman’s state case became a Federal indictment was reported exclusively by me at Patribotics. RICO and Enterprise Corruption cases are typically principally on financial and other crimes such as money laundering, corruption and so forth. However, in this case, there were also national security implications, which is why FISC took jurisdiction of the case from Schneiderman once it was determined that it touched upon Federal issues. Mr. Schneiderman dismissed his case at state level in order that his evidence should form the basis of a federal case. As a state Attorney General, Schneiderman did not need a judge’s permission to do this.The existence of the sealed indictment against Donald Trump was reported by Claude Taylor and me exclusively for Patribotics.There will be more on this breaking story later today."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8c4db6510aa000b740"},"text":"Yesterday, the Guardian published an article about my reporting that was false on the facts. It made the serious allegation, as fact, that I sourced my stories from a hoaxer with whom I have never interacted in any way.The writer, Jon Swaine, put to me that I had used her as a source. I told him I had not. As far as I can see from emails this story quotes, the hoaxer herself has not even claimed to have interacted with me. Yet the Guardian stated that “lurid allegations” made by me about Donald Trump, Trump Models and Eric Schneiderman’s investigation into Trump for human trafficking came from this hoaxer.That is categorically untrue.Mr. Swaine also stated that Claude Taylor was the author of my piece on Orrin Hatch. This is, again, categorically false. Any person may read that piece and see that Taylor’s name is not on it.Swaine’s piece made a number of false allegations about my reporting on Donald Trump and Trump Models. This, the headline, is false. None of my allegations came from this hoaxer. Not one. I find it illuminating that the Guardian does not even name in the headline the citizen journalist who was indeed deceived. The entire piece seems to be an effort to place his errors in my hands.This, the secondary strap, is false. The criminal inquiry that I report – that of AG Schneiderman of New York into Donald Trump and Trump Models does indeed exist. I have not tweeted any ‘detail’ on it, nor reported any, in my work.This is false. Absolutely none of my reporting was based on any information from this hoaxer. Claude Taylor confirmed that he and I never spoke once about my story .This is false. Claude may have tweeted both fake details and tweeted based on a hoaxer. The allegation “that Trump’s inactive fashion model agency is under investigation by New York authorities for possible sex trafficking” is entirely true. The allegations are authentic, they are true, and the case is ongoing. I did not endorse Claude’s view because he tweeted it; I endorsed it because it is true, from my own sources. The record will show that I did not endorse as true things that I do not know myself are true, for example, specific details of cases.The rest of the article follows the same pattern, with additional embarrassing failures by Swain of basic fact checking.This is false. My story about Senator Hatch is not “by Taylor and Mensch”. It is by me and me alone. Swaine apparently did not even click on the link to check. My story does not state Hatch is replacing Trump as President in a secret process. It states, accurately, that Hatch began to receive the Presidential Daily Briefing after James Comey was fired. “Trump’s Presidency Ended May 9th” is a quote from an intelligence source, obviously being metaphorical, which is clearly marked as a quote in the headline. I write:The Guardian piece continues:Again, this is wrong. My own sources report that Bill Clinton went to James Comey after he was forced on to Loretta Lynch’s plane by kompromat Russia held, derived from Jeffrey Epstein. My sources are entirely independent of this hoaxer (they include male sources) and they are known to me. Therefore, while Claude may have based his tweets on a demented manufacturer of fake news, my tweets on Bill Clinton and Epstein / Comey are based on sources linked to the intelligence community. I stated what I said based on my own information. Where Claude’s source, the hoaxer, asserted something I did not know, I used the conditional ‘this would be’ and ‘likely‘. I do however report that Clinton will be a witness against Trump on human trafficking via Trump models. That is, according to my independent sources who have knowledge of the crimes on which Trump and his company are being investigated, absolutely true.Again and again, throughout his piece, Jon Swaine takes the unsustainable and untrue position that if the hoaxer references a thing, it is false, and if I tweet anything referred to by the hoaxer, my tweets are based on the hoaxer’s emails. Let me state again for the record I have never had any contact with her, nor does she claim I did:The claim by Taylor may have been based on a liar, but the claim itself is not false. It is wholly and entirely true. Nor are my allegations “vague”. They are sourced and they are detailed. They were written up in an article. I have further accused Donald Trump of illegal sexual acts with trafficking victims. That too is sourced, to people linked to the intelligence community, known to me, and verified by me, in positions to know of the matter. I stand by both my article and my allegations on social media. They are sourced and they are true. They have been fact-checked by multiple intelligence sources. I resile from none of them, and Swaine and the Guardian will never be able to show that I relied on some hoaxer for the simple reason that I did not do so.Finally, Mr. Swaine appears to admit almost at the end of his piece that in point of fact, I had reported on Schneiderman’s investigation before this hoaxer even contacted Claude Taylor.Yes. That seems relevant, does it not?In many cases, under the false headlineMr. Swaine and the Guardian reprint dated emails, from this hoaxer, referring to real reporting I have published on Patribotics months prior to her ever contacting Taylor. Swaine then asserts – as with Orrin Hatch and the Presidential Daily Briefing, my story from May 2016, which, without checks, he states Taylor wrote – false conclusions. He asserts that because the hoaxer mentions something I have reported before she contacted Taylor, it is false.In an email dated July 20th, the hoaxer writes:This, however, is based on my report of May 29, 2017:This is, however, based on my much earlier reporting on Guiliani, based on a FOIA lawsuit I filed with the James Madison project. As far back as May 10th I stated that Giuliani was talking to the Feds and to Schneiderman, who, I reported, had an Enterprise Corruption case against Trump and the Trump Organization.I repeated that on July 19, before the hoaxer’s email to Taylor ten days later:Remember folks – despite my reporting predating the hoaxer’s references by months, Mr. Swaine asserts without merit that I base my allegations on her emails. Take this gem, dated July 27th, 2017. The hoaxer writes:This is quite simply a mash-up of my own sourced and detailed reporting on money laundering for Trump, shell companies and the Trump children’s involvement in shell companies and money-laundering.I published “Daughtergate” on Ivanka Trump and her brothers, shell companies and money laundering on June 17th, over a month prior to this email.Yet Swaine and the Guardian insist that my allegations are based on some much later hoaxer, emailing months after my publication?I published my piece on shell companies and Trump hacking way back on April 23rd. The Sater Bayrock money laundering case being the sealed indictment for RICO, on which I reported May 29th, was, as I said, started in Schneiderman’s state jurisdiction.I warned repeatedly that – contrary to what the hoaxer was feeding Claude Taylor – there were no sealed indictments based on Trump Models. My sources state this investigation is preliminary. I sent these warnings of mine to the Guardian.My remedies are to make a complaint through the Guardian’s editorial system, which I will do, and if they refuse to correct the factual errors in their piece, to sue the author and the paper. That would be a last resort. It is a great burden on private citizens to have to take on media companies. The Guardian is, however, one of a handful of papers that has not signed up to IPSO, the independent press regulator in the UK, that normally adjudicates complaints from members of the public.I have made complaints to IPSO’s predecessor body only twice in my career, and been sustained both times. One such paper was the Sunday Times, a respected broadsheet newspaper, and the other was the equally respected New Statesman.It is better not to complain and to allow yourself to be vindicated by events. But in these cases, the falsehoods were seriously damaging to my reputation, partly because it was serious papers who made them. The corrections were welcome.I hope very much that the Guardian’s own process will review my complaint fairly. It is always, in my view, worth trusting the ethics of editors before jumping straight to a lawsuit. In this case, as detailed in this piece, I believe facts and dates will bear me out, especially combined with the fact that Taylor denies, and the hoaxer does not claim, that I had any contact with either of them over this story.In a later piece, I will detail my standards for sourcing and fact checking (spoiler: all my sources are human beings known to me) and list my claims that have been borne out by later mainstream media reports thus far."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8d4db6510aa000b741"},"text":"Sources with links to the intelligence community report that there is SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence, on the Sheriff Clarke’s collusion with Russia, held by a Five Eyes nation. Sheriff Clarke withdrew his name for consideration for a position in the Department of Homeland Security.White House sources report that contrary to some online reaction from commentators assuming the mendacious Clarke had invented the whole thing, Clarke was indeed being considered for this position, despite his problems with law enforcement. However, sources say that when Clarke’s application for security clearance was presented there was ‘laughter’. ‘He was told he would never get a security clearance in a million years,’ one source said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.Sources with links to the intelligence communities of two separate Five Eyes intelligence partners have confirmed that one specific barrier to Clarke getting a security clearance is SIGINT of his communications in Moscow with individuals linked to Oleg Deripaska and Vladimir Putin. This intelligence concerns their instructions to Clarke to go back to America and foment dissent and attacks on the peaceful ‘Black Lives Matter’ protest movement.Attacking ‘Black Lives Matter’, a just and peaceable movement protesting racism in the police and unnecessary killings of African-Americans was a target of disruption by paid Russian trolls such as Cassandra Fairbanks, a Russian agent of influence working for Sputnik, and Anthime Gionnet, another Russian agent of influence working for both Trump and Putin. Both Russian agents of influence pretended to be for Bernie Sanders and in favor of Black Lives Matter and its just cause before switching overtly to Trump. But they did it – on Russia’s instructions –  in a hate-filled way, trying to smear Black Lives Matter as opposed to the lives and safety of police officers. Here are some examples of a typical Oleg Deripaska / Erik Prince psyop, according to my sources:  Clarke’s instructions from Deripaska and Putin – Deripaska is a key lieutenant of Mr. Putin’s, posting pictures from his instagram account of the two men together – were not, however, to pretend to be an ally of the social justice movement. Instead,  he was designated to lead the charge against them and stir up social division.  I had to attend the GOP Convention in Cleveland as part of my prior job editing Heat Street, and witnessed such racism and misogyny that I wound up apologizing in person (and in tears) to two BLM protestors who braved the crowd streaming towards the convention center. Inside I was unfortunate enough to witness Sheriff Clarke give a speech, which wound up with him leading a chant of ‘All Lives Matter’ after attacking the Black Lives Matter movement. Free speech is an important part of US democracy, and Clarke was not obliged to accept or to approve of ‘Black Lives Matter’. But sadly for him and for Donald Trump and Steve Bannon, sources report there is solid signals intelligence on Clarke and Deripaska/Putin with instructions to attack Black Lives Matter.Clarke’s many previous defiant stances against the law include unlawful immigration actions. A prisoner died of thirst in his jail. Sources have not yet reported whether or not a murder investigation has been opened against Clarke, but if I receive such a report, I will update this story.I should repeat the “warning” I received from a wholly different source over my reporting on Mr. Deripaska which I perceive to be a death threat; I first reported this yesterday on my story on the 18 year old woman Miranda Crowley and the Carolina Conspiracy, in which, sources alleged, Mr. Deripaska had a hand. I regard this warning as a death threat and am reporting it to the FBI. I will continue to report on Vladimir Putin’s attack on the United States at patribotics, without fear or favor.“NSA friend is yet again worried about your safety because of the Deripaska stories. They said to be VERY careful and they assume you know the risks, but Deripaska is unlikely to go to jail once all is said and done, so if you ruin business for him bc of your revelations, then you and family may become his targets. They said to be extremely careful just for this reason. your info is correct of course, but they’re worried about your safety.” More of our ground-breaking coverage here:"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8d4db6510aa000b742"},"text":"Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak’s phone was both hacked and turned into a ‘hot mike’ for recording conversations by a Five Eyes intelligence agency,Sources with links to Western intelligence report that a similar ‘SS7’ exploit as that used by consent on the phones of James Comey, and other FBI agents, by the FBI and Justice Department, was placed on the phone of Sergei Kislyak – most certainly without consent – and that the Russian Ambassador to the US not only had his phone bugged, but that his phone was being used as a microphone to record those with whom he was speaking.Sources do not say when the exploit was placed on Kislyak’s phone. One source speculated that Ambassador Kislyak had only survived in his position in America ‘because of optics’.The Five Eyes intelligence agreement prevents members of the world’s premier intelligence alliance – America, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom – from spying on each other’s territories and citizens. However, crucially, embassies, such as those of Ecuador in London and Russia in Washington DC, are regarded as sovereign territory of their native countries. The NSA is free to spy within the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and GCHQ, its British equivalent, is free to spy within Russia’s embassy in DC. The Five Eyes alliance is the closest intelligence partnership in the world. Recently Canada assisted DGSE, France’s CIA, in spying on Rebel Media on behalf of M. Macron, the then French Presidential candidate. Sources report that both the FBI, NSA and Britain’s GCHQ assisted Canada in this operation, because of the involvement of the Trump-Russia partisan Jack Posobiec.In his testimony to the Senate today, Jeff Sessions, who as Patribotics reported in February, was a suspect in the Trump Russia hack, suddenly changed his tune, admitting that he “might have” had a conversation with Kislyak at the Mayflower Hotel.As I reported exclusively earlier this year, Page, Manafort, Epshteyn and Kislyak, along possibly with Donald Trump himself, were recorded by US intelligence discussing the tape promising a policy shift in exchange for help with the elections, at the Mayflower. If Sessions was there, he was recorded too. Sources with links to the U.S. intelligence community now report that the group of men played the tape that was to be played in Moscow by Page and then, literally, had a discussion about trading it for hacking help, a discussion which is in the possession of US intelligence. It is not known however if this tape was recorded via a Five Eyes SS7 exploit placed on Mr. Kislyak’s phone, or by normal surveillance of any Russian Ambassador on US soil that is always carried out by the American authorities.Sources with links to Western intelligence would not give any details of when the exploit was placed or how long it had lasted.Sources with links to US intelligence confirmed, as I exclusively reported on Patribotics, that Speaker Paul Ryan was taped speaking to Sergei Kislyak at the GOP Convention, as was Reince Priebus, agreeing to accept laundered or ‘dark’ Russian funds for the GOP. Sources with links to the Justice Department earlier confirmed that a RICO case is being prepared against the entire Republican party on the basis of Russian money and intelligence, in the form of Wikileaks stories, being given to it as a body. Director Comey, who consensually allowed the SS7 exploit on his phone, testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that Jeff Sessions would always have had to recuse himself on the Russia inquiry because serious concerns were known to him, Comey, about Sessions’ conduct with Russia.Mr. Sessions has always been a prime suspect in the Trump Russia inquiry, long before he was nominated as Attorney General, as I reported in February on the day of his confirmation. He will now be wondering – along with the Russians – just how much intelligence Five Eyes has managed to gather, and for how long, from Mr. Kislyak’s phone.Western intelligence sources said that their motives for speaking on background on this matter were to warn Mr. Trump and his associates that further covering up or attacks on the U.S. intelligence community, particularly on Director Comey’s integrity, would not be tolerated. Laws governing intelligence ‘leaks’ or whistleblowing do not apply to the sovereign allies of the United States, many of whom, both inside and outside Five Eyes, have hard signals intelligence on Donald Trump and his family. DGSE, who as a NATO ally outside Five Eyes are not prevented from spying on Americans by treaties, have recordings of Donald Trump Jr speaking to Russian intelligence in France, as one example.Multiple, separate sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one nation, used the phrase ‘gloves off’ when describing the situation with Russia and Trump. Vladimir Putin has attempted to intervene in Brexit, in the French election and in elections all over Europe, and has personally exposed all of Russia, and that nation’s economy, to the intense rage of the far richer and more powerful Western world. Understanding the principle of ‘deniabilty,’ intelligence sources inside and outside the US intelligence community have suggested that leaks of information by allied nations may serve US intelligence by freeing them from blowing the whistle themselves. Sources linked to one specific Five Eyes intelligence partner noted that ‘deniability’ is designed to allow witnesses to tell the truth on the stand. If, theoretically, British intelligence sources were to disclose information on Mike Flynn – as retired MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove did to the Financial Times – US intelligence would not be consulted, even through a back channel, these sources said.Sources reported that Director Comey was regarded with affection throughout allied intelligence, and that Donald Trump’s scornful attitude towards NATO – since Trump is perceived as a mere proxy of Russia, without thought or direction of his own, by the west – has enraged allied intelligence services, who are more than prepared to judiciously release intelligence at strategic times (such as Mr. Sessions’ testimony) to make it clear that Russia and Trump standing in the way of the FBI and Director Mueller’s inquiry will not be tolerated."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8d4db6510aa000b743"},"text":"Sources with links to the intelligence community report that Federal Marshals executed two search and seizure warrants at Trump Tower on Friday, May 19.One of the warrants covered an electronic storage space in Trump Tower. Several electronic items were seized as a result of this search.Another of the warrants, sources report, was served on Paul Manafort’s apartment in Trump Tower.Unlike the first warrant, this warrant was served, sources say, with “consent.” That means that Mr. Manafort is almost certainly co-operating with Federal authorities.The Trump Data team worked out of Trump Tower. Separate sources, with links to the intelligence and law enforcement communities, report that the FBI is looking at photographs posted publicly on  Twitter by members of that team that appear to show a Python server connection loading on the screens of one of the Trump data team workers.These same sources have confirmed my April reporting that the Russian Alfa Bank server, with an ip address in Trump Tower, was communicating with Russia and Spectrum Health, and that it was ‘washing’ hacked U.S. State voter database information with the social media ‘fake news’ botnet for micro-targeting to voters. There will be a separate piece of analysis on how this might relate to the ‘electronic devices’ that were seized on Friday afternoon, 19 May. Sources report that this was done ‘very quietly’, in an attempt to evade detection by the press.The servers and data in Trump Tower, and the items taken from Manafort’s apartment, may form part of the “secure communications channel” that Kushner wanted to establish with Russia. I broke on November 7th that a FISA warrant had been secured on any US person’ in relation to two Russian banks, Alfa Bank – with whom the server was communicating – and SVB Bank. SVB Bank, which had a deal with Sberbank, is implicated in the meeting Kushner had with Gorkov. Further to that, Avi Berkowitz, who was on the Trump Data team, working with Boris Epshteyn and Brad Parscale, formed a go-between for Kushner and the Russian Ambassador.My earlier exclusive report stated that the Kelhios botnet for which the Russian hacker Pyotr Levashov was indicted, was run out of Trump Tower with a ‘command and control server.’The Trump sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., were interviewed by the FBI, sources say, the day before James Comey was fired. This is because, sources linked to the intelligence and law enforcement communities say, they are suspected of being complicit in the Kelhios botnet’s repurposing to service and pay both pro-Russia and pro-Trump Twitter and facebook bots, but also to deliver ‘fake news’, loaded with malware, and to pay those spreading it through bitcoin transactions.One of the reasons James Comey was illegally fired by Trump was that his investigation was at the point of interviewing Trump’s own sons. For the avoidance of doubt, White House sources report that Donald Trump himself is considered by investigators to be directly complicit in Russia’s hack of the American election, and Trump fears that the FBI has data-based evidence that will prove this."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8d4db6510aa000b744"},"text":"By Louise Mensch and Claude Taylor Multiple sources confirm that Pamela Talkin, Marshal of the Supreme Court, was dispatched to the White House by Chief Justice Roberts last Friday. The decision to send her was taken, sources say, when White House Counsel, Don McGahn, did not release Rudy Giuliani’s ‘Muslim memo’, despite an order of the court* to do so by that date.The White House failed to meet the May 19th deadline to hand over the Giuliani memo, violating this order. The order states, among other things:A list of current suits in which the ‘Giuliani memo’ is vital evidence include ones at the Eastern District of Virginia, Case #17-cv-00120, Sarsour vs Trump; the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, a case that originated in Maryland, Case #17-1351, International Refugee Assistance Project v Trump; The State of Hawaii v Trump, case #17-cv-00050 at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals; and the case that triggered the decision to send the Marshal of the SCOTUS to Trump, Case #17-10310 at the Eastern District of Michigan, Arab American Civil Rights League et al v Trump.Violating a court order is colloquially called ‘Contempt of Court’ and this matter falls within the standards of impeachment for a President under the constitution. The Trump Administration had not filed a motion of leave, or availed themselves of any legal mechanism to deny the order to provide the Guiliani memo by the 19th of May.Chief Justice Roberts was concerned about both the preservation of evidence and Trump’s disregard for legal orders of the courts. He sent Marshal Talkin to the White House on Friday night, in order to tell Donald Trump that he was ordered to keep and preserve all evidence relating to this matter. Marshal Talkin was told by White House staff – brusquely, sources say – that she was too late to deliver the message to Mr. Trump; he had already left for his first trip overseas.Marshal Talkin was not deterred. Sources report she ordered her escort to drive her straight to Andrews Air Force base. She met Trump on the tarmac, and delivered the message of the Chief Justice. Multiple sources, from law enforcement, to those linked to the intelligence community, sources linked to the military, and those linked to various different parts of the Justice Department and of the judicial system, report that Marshal Talkin informed Trump that if he were not to preserve and protect evidence, in line with orders of the courts, it would constitute a further impeachable offense; that is to say, a separate impeachable offense, additional to the case of impeachment which has already legally begun against him.More on this breaking story as we receive it.  Whistleblowers are encouraged to get in touch on our secure protonmail email address.*Correction: I originally attached the wrong court to the order linked in the text; as stated below, the case that triggered the Chief Justice’s decision to send the Marshal to the White House was Case #17-10310 at the Eastern District of Michigan, Arab American Civil Rights League et al v Trump."}

A separate source confirms that the FISA warrant I reported on November 7th at Heat Street, granted against two Russian banks, was in fact two separate FISA warrants, granted on the same day. These two warrants form part of the six total granted warrants sources report, although, these sources say, there may be further FISA warrants both granted and renewed.On Jan 11th Paul Wood of the BBC reported exclusively that the exact date of the FISA warrant against these banks – now clarified by sources to have been two separate warrants, one for each bank, Alfa Bank and Silicon Valley Bank – was October 15th. My story designated the date merely as October.As the Trump-Russia prosecutions come closer, further details are emerging from varied sources.Today (Sat, May 6th) on the AM Joy show on MSNBC, Joy Ann Reid became the first national broadcaster to refer to Grand Juries possibly summoned in the case of Donald Trump’s team and its collusion with the Russian government.She referenced the tweet of Claude Taylor, whose sources had told him exclusively that Federal Grand Juries had almost completed their work. Taylor’s sources had told him that state and federal Grand Juries were convening in the case of the Trump team’s collusion with Russia.I can add to the story that sources have pointed me at PACER records in both the Eastern District of Virginia and the Southern District of New York, which I have verified independently. In his testimony to the Judiciary Committee this past week, Mr. Comey specified that the FBI was working with ‘two main sets of prosecutors’ – one being the Eastern District of Virginia, popularly known as the ‘rocket docket’.I have independently verified that these cases do exist. In the Eastern District of Virginia, “Case Name Not on File” was filed on April 17th, with the Movant listed as the U.S. Government.In the Southern District of New York, also on April 17th a RICO case was filed, with the plaintiff not listed. In the Eastern District of Virginia, the Movant is publicly listed as the US Government – there is less information in the New York Southern District Court.Both of these cases are, at the time of writing, available on search records without access to the PACER system.Here is the publicly available information for the Eastern District of Virginia Court:and here is the information for the RICO case in New York:There will be more on this developing story as we receive it."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8e4db6510aa000b747"},"text":"Sources linked to the intelligence community say that General Mike Flynn’s trips to Cambridge and across Europe will form a key part of Donald Trump’s impeachment and the prosecutions of dozens of his associates.According to several sources within the intelligence community, Michael Flynn was co-ordinating, with and for Russian agents, the drafting of messages that Vladimir Putin was using to attack democracy in not only the United States, but across Europe. Furthermore, Flynn was doing this with the full knowledge of the Trump campaign, including Donald Trump himself.This news directly relates to the data laundering performed by the Alfa Bank server on behalf of Donald Trump and Russia, where, as I reported, the Trump campaign colluded with the hacking of both the DNC and state voter databases.The Alfa Bank server ‘washed’ that data together to tell Trump where to target it, sources say. But the messages and content with which targets were served was co-ordinated with Russia by General Flynn.Furthermore, Flynn took the same hacking tools and artificial intelligence coded in Russia and helped far-right and Nazi parties across Europe use it in their own nations. Intelligence sources assert that multiple NATO partners have evidence of this and that it has been provided to the FBI.If ‘data laundering’ is the first part of the Trump Russia incontrovertible evidence, ‘propaganda targeting’ is the second part. Flynn attacked not only the United States but all her Western allies on Russia’s behalf, with the full knowledge and connivance of Donald Trump.Both halves of the social media impeachment will, sources assert, be key to Director Comey’s overall case. This is the ‘incontrovertible evidence’ to which Sir Richard Dearlove and others have referred.The broad case of Russia’s hacking the US election can be divided into two relatively simple spheres. There is another branch of the criminal investigation that focuses on money-laundering and corrupt payments from Russia and Russian satellites to Mr. Trump and to his allies. But the actual hacking of the US election follows a relatively simple narrative line in two halves; hacking and targeting. Mr. Flynn’s activities spanned the two and link them to Russian active measures all across Europe, including the current attack on the French election.As I previously reported in an exclusive story on this blog, Alfa Bank in Russia’s server was communicating to the Trump campaign hacked data from state voter databases and the DNC’s own voter targeting engine, Vertica. It was also laundering money to pay these hackers to the Trump campaign. These two functions were performed by the Alfa Bank server communicating with the Trump and Spectrum Health servers.The precise combination of these two databases allowed Cambridge Analytica and SCL both to create Russian-directed propaganda and target it at voting groups with extraordinary precision. Intelligence sources clarified that SVB bank, the second bank named in the FISA warrant I exclusively reported on Nov 7th, was also involved in messaging the Trump server, by sending Cambridge Analytica targeting and SCL propaganda to it, to be washed with the databases and money Alfa Bank was sending that server.[Editor’s note – the two preceding paragraphs have been corrected. They originally erroneously said that the Alfa server was sending the voter databases to the Trump server, when in fact it was laundering money to pay to hackers and others who would spread the propaganda created by SCL]The technology behind Cambridge Analytica’s targeting was stolen from Facebook by Alexander Kogan, who has gone to Singapore and renamed himself Alex Spectre. In many ways, the Trump-Russia story begins and ends at Cambridge University. Dimtry Firtash, the corrupt Russian oligarch who is Paul Manafort’s patron, gave Cambridge £6 million pounds  since 2010. With that money evidently came a large ring of Russian spies, probably including Kogan.Fake news in the 2016 election was not, in fact, fake news. It was real propaganda, coordinated and paid for by the Russian state. General Flynn was actively involved on Russia’s behalf, sources say, with discussing how this propaganda could be used and targeted across Europe and elsewhere, as well as in Donald Trump’s campaign.Sir Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6, told the Financial Times that he and other British former spies had left a dining club at Cambridge – a club to which Flynn belonged – because of concerns about Russian intelligence penetrating it. General Flynn had been a regular attendee, the story said. It added that British intelligence was extremely concerned about some ‘startups’ in Cambridge being Russian intelligence, notably Veruscript.The story did not get much attention in the America MSM, but I recognise the worthy papers an intelligence veteran in the UK might use to front-face something for reporters. (If Sir Richard is reading this report I do hope he will consider giving it to me next time. I could have told him firewalls = death for dissemination).The Guardian followed this up with a story about a probable woman FSB agent or asset at Cambridge, to whom General Flynn, who is as vain as he is stupid, had signed billets-doux marked “General Misha”, the Russian word for Mike.In Cambridge, intelligence sources say, Flynn was meeting with not only those who had coded the technology but Russian spies talking about the propaganda it should distribute.However, Flynn did not stop there. With the full knowledge of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, “General Misha” continued his Nazi “tour of Europe”, with meetings both in Europe and of the EU far right at Trump Tower, discussing how the Russian propaganda of SCL could be targeted directly in their countries in order to swing their elections. Notably, Flynn was caught with the head of the far-right party in Austria. This man was  then invited by Donald Trump to the inauguration. Other far-right Russian allies invited to the inauguration, or who came to meet Trump Russia associates at Trump tower, and who were assisted by the Russian botnet and Russian propaganda, include Marine Le Pen and Nigel Farage.Sir Richard and US sources have indicated to the Guardian newspaper that Director Comey has direct and incontrovertible evidence that Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia. This relates to the FISA warrant that I reported on November 7th and my April 1st report (which I had previously published as a theory) that the AlfaBank server was laundering two hacked databases together for targeting – the DNC’s own and the voter registration databases. However, the other parts of that evidence, I can report today, involve General Flynn’s discussions with Russian spies and the EU far-right on how they could use similar technology to hack and target Russian active measures in their own country.In this scenario, it is easy to see that “Honest Misha” Flynn thought of himself as the leading commander for Russia’s attack on the West.How the Magax3 Pac, “Microchip” and the Russian botnet worked directly with Donald Trump and Mike Flynn under the aegis of Russian intelligenceIf Peter Chayanov, (one of his many names), is the hacking villain of Trump-Russia, as I have previously reported, the ‘Microchip’ persona is the targeting villain of the piece.Exclusively on Patribotics by Laurelai Bailey, we broke the story that one week before the DNC emails were published, Wikileaks bought two full servers located in Russia.Next, we broke the story, based on what I have called COSINT – crowdsourced, open-source intelligence – that Wikileaks had actually handed their SSL keys to Chayanov and therefore to Putin. What that means in layman terms is that the Russian dictator can now see the IP addresses of anybody reading Wikileaks, (helpful with targeting propaganda at them, as he sees what stories they are reading), and also the IP addresses used now or in the past by any donors to Wikileaks – of money or leaks. That means Putin can blackmail whistleblowers from the US military and elsewhere into becoming his spies. I further reported, based on intelligence sources that it was Chayanov’s company Hostkey that US intelligence determined hacked the state voter databases (named in their October 7th statement as ‘a Russian company’). Because the USIC named Wikileaks as a Russian government actor in that same statement, and because Chayanov holds Wikileaks SSL keys and servers, USIC now knows, if it did not before, that the Russian government hacked the state voter databases. The motherlode of the DNC leaks was not the DNC emails Wikileaks released; rather, it was the Vertica database that the DNC used and which had files on the voting behavior of all listed voters (hence the BernieBros that disappeared from Twitter – they were designed to suppress the Clinton vote). The Steele Dossier, which sources say is true in all important respects, states that Russian moles in the DNC leaked the files to Russia – they were as much hackers as Snowden was at the USA. Because there are too many states to place leakers in, Chayanov was forced actually to hack the state voter registration databases.The Trump server was washing these two databases together for targeting by the campaign as I exclusively reported, with further exclusive reporting on the precise method by TeaPainUSA, here.Next, with the accurate data provided by the data laundering, the Trump campaign needed to target voting groups with accuracy. It did this by creating fake news and ugly memes, and receiving these from Russian sources. Agents of influence of Russia used to propel these fake stories and memes included Sputnik, Jack Posobiec, and the “botnet” created by Microchip, who is a composite persona. Microchip are Russian agents of influence, and began to create the pro-Trump troll net in 2015, according to Buzzfeed. As well as actual bots based on keywords, the Microchip Russian botnet used human beings and particular hashtags to push the AI themed messaging. Trump’s campaign created fake news to order. Flynn’s twitter account, and that of his son, were lambasted for publishing fake news, but in point of fact it is easy – and provable – to see that the Microchip botnet of Russia was tweeting from the account. Flynn’s twitter used the same exact hashtags and linked back to the MagaX3 PAC. He also pushed out the Wikileaks releases of the stolen DNC material (now declared by the CIA to be Russian active measures) with hashtags like #PodestaEmails19 as they arose (remember, anybody clicking on these links had now given their IP address to Putin).Flynn was working in Trump Tower with ‘Chief Facebook Officer’ Guido Lombardi, profile in Politico EU, using their mutual hatred of Islam as a wedge issue.Below, the screenshot shows Flynn pushing out this Russian co-ordinated propaganda targeted by Lombardi.Lombardi, Flynn and Gaffney, along with Devin Nunes, were in the Transition Team and were willing to slam US intelligence and military leaders.A story that I myself reported for Heat Street in October, 2016 – before I reported the FISA warrant on Alfa Bank and SVB Bank – that concerned Trump’s bots and trolls actually pointed to a lot of what is reported here. Because I did note in that story that the Russian botnet AI had spread far beyond America and existed in multiple languages.I further pointed out that all these countries had certain tropes in common. Support for Trump, Brexit, Viktor Orban, and Nigel Farage as well as Marine Le Pen.It now turns out that on his trips to Cambridge and through the EU, General Misha Flynn was specifically co-ordinating Russian propaganda for the far right.The Alfa Bank server’s washing of the voter registration and Vertica databases is one half of the incontrovertible evidence that will see Donald Trump impeached. But Moscow Mike Flynn’s Treason Tour of Europe is the other half of it. Flynn is the key not only to Vladimir Putin’s attack on America, but also to his attack on the entire Western World.An attack in which Donald J Trump was fully and totally complicit."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8e4db6510aa000b748"},"text":"Exclusive analysis by Laurelai Bailey, published by Patribotics this week confirmed that Julian Assange and Wikileaks obtained two new servers in Russia just one week before the hacked Podesta emails were released.Laurelai reported that the ultimate registrant of the servers was one Peter Chayanov, of Russia, a known cyber-criminal and hacker.Julian Assange has been identified by the US intelligence community as a front for Russian distribution and ‘deniability’ of Russian government-sponsored hacking. Today, however, as a result of our reporting on the dox by Op Ferguson, that link is far clearer.The internet is tightly controlled in Russia. Cyber criminals have to answer to Putin. Mr. Chayanov is the head of a firm called Hostkey, which hosts mail spammers and other malware and hacking tools, despite offering web space to Wikileaks. Wikileaks chose to use a Russian hacker to host their site – and they knew that he was connected to Vladimir Putin and operated with the blessing of Putin’s government.Putin and Assange are thus already linked.But it is much worse for Wikileaks – and the internet in general – even than it looks. In order not to bury the lede, I will report what appear to be the conclusions of the web developers and hackers on Twitter discussing Laurelai’s story, and then report on how they appeared to have arrived there.* Wikileaks has handed Chayanov access to everything stored on its site and servers* The Russian hacker and spammer can ‘monitor traffic’* He can tell who is reading anything on the Wikileaks site anywhere in the world* The Russian hacker has access to all documents that have been sent to Wikileaks* He can probably bust the anonymity of any computer or user who thought they were anonymously donating to Wikileaks* It is not reasonable to suggest that this hacker is other than linked with Russia’s GRU – if he has it, they have it* Through Julian Assange and his website, it appears that the Russian hacker and his government can track any readers of the Wikileaks site and any donors of material to it, thus allowing Russia to ‘blackmail’ anyone who ‘sent secrets’ to Wikileaks as a ‘whistleblower’.I will update this story later in the day summarizing discussions among the hacker and developer community on Twitter that led to this bombshell conclusion.All of the above appear to be factual statements. It is not a fact that Russia did indeed monitor web traffic to Wikileaks, but it seems to be an absolute fact that if they want to, they can – and it seems, from the reaction of Mr. Chayanov upon being outed, almost totally certain that Julian Assange handed Russia the keys to the Wikileaks site deliberately.When Julian Assange wrote “Wikileak the Government” he apparently meant “Wikileaks is the Government (of Russia)”.A subsequent post will explore the further possibility that Peter Chayanov is also Guccifer2 – providing the materials that hacked the US election, as well as helping Assange and Wikileaks work with Putin to do so."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8e4db6510aa000b749"},"text":"Andy Wigmore, the right-hand man to Arron Banks and Nigel Farage, has admitted that he has been questioned by Bob Mueller in regards to the Trump Russia inquiry.Mr. Wigmore stated on Twitter that he spoken to Bob Mueller’s team at the FBI’s Field Office in Washington, DC. He posted a cheerful picture of himself wearing an FBI t-shirt taken at those offices, to me directly, on August 27th:After the Guardian reported that Nigel Farage was declared to be a ‘person of interest’ in the FBI’s criminal investigation into Trump Russia collusion, matters appeared to go quiet, until this week a U.K MP, Labour’s Ben Bradshaw, a former Culture Secretary, called for the Electoral Commission to examine whether Russia interfered in Brexit.In the interim, Mr. Wigmore was interviewed by Robert Mueller’s team (he said) and the FBI. It is important to note that these two are not the same thing. Mr. Mueller’s team could have interviewed Wigmore at the FBI Field Office, the FBI could have interviewed him, or both could have done so separately.When a user suggested to Wigmore that ‘there was collusion, treason with Russia’, Wigmore replied:“really no there wasn’t – but you believe what u want to – even Mueller realise he’s looking stupid – he’s pretty cross he’s been sold a crock of shit and wants revenge on the leakers and recipients”He went on to say that I was “on a list” he received from Julian Assange as a recipient of leaks and would therefore shortly be arrested by the FBI myself:“Your name mentioned Loo Loo – hope you’ve never seen or handled or even were told about leaks – your contacts about to drop you right in it…”He further said that if Senator John McCain went down, “so do you”.I double checked with Wigmore that he had been interviewed, which he confirmed. He added again that Julian Assange had my name on a list of those who had ‘handled stolen secrets’ (with no discernible sense of irony).  “See @JulianAssange about to announce the secret leakers and who handled stolen secrets, saw your name going to prison!praying for you Loo”, he said.Mr. Wigmore is dyslexic and therefore I am unsure whether he meant to use the singular or if it was a typo for ‘Russians’. I pointed out that I had not mentioned any Russians in my tweet about Mnuchin and Trump being recorded by GCHQ at Trump Turnberry. This exchange may be worth reproducing:Me: Andy, I didn’t mention a given Russian.Mr. Wigmore: I know exactly what you are referring to – you forget our company stuffed with ex @gchq 5/6 SAS – not difficult dopeyI followed up on Mr. Wigmore’s assertion that Russians based in Scotland, connected to the Russian shooting team, were involved in the June 24th plot to hack America – something my article did not suggest – and was interested to read his defense of one Mr. Lisin using only his surname, as though the two were familiar with each other.Mr. Wigmore adamantly proclaims his innocence in the hack of the American election by the Russians.*this reporter declares her interest in that Mr. Wigmore promised her an FBI Washington Field Office t-shirt, which she is keen to receive from him, though not at the apparent price of taking tea at Trump Towers.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8e4db6510aa000b74a"},"text":"I have an overarching theory of Russia’s attack on America and the West. Here it is.There have not been a series of attacks on America and Europe by Vladimir Putin. There has been one single operation; it is the same operation.By 2008, possibly even earlier, according to John Schindler, a National Security expert formerly at the NSA, Russia had placed moles in the highest levels of US counter-intelligence. I take this as my starting-point, because all the subsequent facts bear it out.Mr. Putin always wanted to use the strength of the West as a lever to attack it, because Russia is weak and poor. So he did, and he used a very old-fashioned and effective method. Spies inside the IC. He also believes in propaganda and mind-games. He uses them on the West, he uses them on Russians, in Russia.Hillary Clinton correctly noted that Putin rigged his own election in 2011. This, apparently, is when he started to hate her.By the 2012 election, Russia’s desire to interfere with American democracy was already there, but it as yet didn’t have the tools to succeed in that aim. I deliberately omit some of the timeline here in order to get to the bigger points in the story, but I will return to it later.Russian moles placed inside the NSA recruited Edward Snowden. A letter between the FSB in Cuba and SENAIN in Quito held in a file marked ‘Assange’ in London, dated 4th April 2013, the day before Snowden sent his only email on legalities, April 5th 2013, and before Snowden took his uppermost level documents during the rest of the month of April, proves conclusively that Mr. Snowden is a Russian agent who acted on instructions from Moscow. After Snowden fled to Hong Kong, he escaped from there by an Ecuadorean travel document arranged by Julian Assange, and tried to get to Cuba.Snowden is a low-level IT idiot. He had help taking what he took from the NSA. I recommend the NSA review their case files and pick up the Russian moles within their agency. Snowden used stolen credentials, but it is almost certain that he received a piece of removable media like a memory card from his Russian handlers. He took military secrets. And by “he” I mean the FSB.In 2013, after the Russians received all of the Snowden files, and China some of them, most press coverage concentrated on the traps that terrorists and Russian spies were able to avoid. They missed that Russian hackers would now proceed to use the NSA’s tech offensively.In 2013, the Russians briefed their army of hackers.In 2012/13, a young Russian hacker called Yvegeny Nikulin, then 26, was using Snowden’s NSA techniques – stolen credentials – to hack LinkedIn, Dropbox and Formspring.Formspring, which shut down late 2013, was the app that Anthony Wiener used for his sexting.According to John Schindler, “a hacker”(Nikulin) was picked up in Prague, October 5th, on suspicion of interfering with the DNC and the Democrats in America’s election. He had been sought on an FBI red warrant.He is being extradited to the United States (if Jeff Sessions, a Russia partisan who recruited the spy Carter Page into Team Trump, does not try to stop it)  over strong protests from Russia. The DoJ announcement on his indictment mentioned not only Formspring, but ‘a count of conspiracy’ and ‘sending a code to a computer’.It was three years later. Nikulin was now 29.On Oct 26, Rudy Giuliani joked on television about a big surprise coming in the election that would turn things around for Trump.On Oct 28, Director James Comey of the FBI announced that more as yet unexamined emails had been found on an old laptop of Mr. Wiener’s.Mr. Putin, it is my surmise that some of the Russian moles inside US counter-intelligence work within the FBI’s criminal division, and particularly, within the New York field office.It is my surmise that your hacker, Nikulin, sent a command buried in a virus earlier transmitted by Formspring to ‘wake up’ that old computer and either find, or place, emails from Huma Abedin on to it, and that you then contacted your moles inside the NYPD/  FBI NY and told them to “suddenly find” emails that, the expectation was, could not possibly be combed through in time before the election.Your agents within the FBI Field Office then did a number of additional things.Firstly, they illegally spoke to any friendly press and the Trump campaign about putative ongoing criminal investigations into the Clinton Foundation and the matter of her email server.They told Fox News’s Brett Baier that Hillary Clinton “Would soon be indicted” and this was reported on TV, and then retracted after the damage was done.They told your agents of influence, Rudy Giuliani and X Kallstrom, that ‘a group of active FBI agents’ had demanded Comey release his letter. Both of them stated as much, Mr. Giuliani specifying ‘active’ FBI agents.They used your agent General Flynn – I scorn to use ‘of influence’ in this case, Flynn knew what he was doing – to say on live television that active FBI agents were talking to him about an going ‘criminal investigation’And they told the New York Times that the FBI ’Saw No Clear Ties to Russia’ in the matter of the Russian bank servers. And the New York Times printed it, even though they, the Times, knew it was false.Before the election, only I reported, correctly, that the FBI’s Counter-Intelligence division in Connecticut had obtained a FISA warrant for ‘any US persons’ relating to the two banks involved in the Trump Tower server; Alfa Bank and SVB Bank.So your moles in the NSA recruited Ed Snowden in 2012/2013.You got to work using NSA hacking techniques. Stealing legit credentials features often. You hacked Wiener in 2013 via Formspring. You waited.You used your moles in the FBI Field Office and, in 2016 at the right moment, you woke up Wiener’s laptop via the ’Snowden Virus’, found or planted old emails on it, and suddenly had the FBI Field Office “find it” and then lean, hard, on Comey to produce the letter he did.Your RIS moles in the FBI then engaged in some agitprop with Giuliani, Flynn, an innocent Fox News, a not-innocent New York Times who deliberately used its prior authority to rubbish Franklin Foer and David Corn’s Alfa Bank server reporting, to make absolutely certain that “Trump-Russia” was suppressed and Clinton was defeated.Your agents in the FBI Field Office in New York did, however, make one incredibly stupid mistake. A coder named Dustin Giebel caught it and he flagged it up to me.The trouble with hiring young and foolish men to flood twitter and Facebook, to act as your hackers and so forth, is that they are young and foolish. Trolls gonna troll.In this case, the Twitter account @FBIRecordsVault ceased being dormant for the first time in two years. It went on a little tweet storm. The last tweets were attacks on Hillary Clinton with a chaser of an attack on Eric Holder, the former AG. The first tweet, however, was a tweet praising Fred C. Trump. (Donald Trump has often said that his father is his only hero). It used language about Mr. Trump senior that was not only unlike any FBI descriptors ever used before, but had been lifted from Donald Trump’s commercial, company website.When I saw that, I was overwhelmed with joy. It was not the severity of the offense, it was its traceability. Somebody sat at a keyboard and typed those tweets. Identifiable people. An FBI statement wrongly said that these were automated responses to three FOIA requests. Not true. Some identifiable person ordered and gave that statement. When I filed a private FOIA lawsuit with Mark S Zaid and Bradley Moss, we wrote the questions in ways that would be difficult to avoid answering. Who wrote those tweets? How many agents knew of them? What records exist of FBI agents or staff visiting the Trump commercial website to lift the descriptor of Fred Trump? What internal investigations exist into FBI agents leaking criminal investigations to Flynn and Giuliani? Do they feature any of the same agents who composed, knew of or authorized the FBI Records Vault tweets?Days after our FOIA requests landed, Mr. Giuliani abruptly withdrew from his application to be Secretary of State. A week after our lawsuit was announced over non-response, the Department of Justice announced an investigation into more or less every matter named in our lawsuit, including the FBI Records Vault’s beautifully traceable tweets.Even little pawns, like Twitter accounts, can become Queens, if you let them reach the 8th square, Mr. Putin.So there you have it. Part One:Russia has moles inside the IC, several of whom are not yet caught.The NSA moles recruit Snowden.Assange Ecuador and Russia give Snowden orders, and removable media to scrape intel and military secrets.Ecuador exfiltrates Snowden to Moscow.2012-2013, Russian hackers are given all of the NSA techniques. Nikulin hacks Formspring and Wiener. He plants a virus in his laptop. He waits and wakes it up in October.Russia’s FBI Field Office moles “suddenly find” the emails, perhaps even placed on that computer, at a crucial juncture.Russia’s FBI Field Office moles pressure Comey into releasing his letter, and thereby spin the election to Trump.How am doing so far, Mr. Putin? You know, for a woman. And an amateur.Or, James Comey’s Counterintelligence FBI vs Rudy Giuliani’s NY Criminal FBIThere are three parts to this theory, like a good play, and narratively, the next section ought to be about your spy ring in the University of Cambridge, your hacking of Facebook and Twitter and your propaganda wars across Europe, but as I have learned from you one must play to the audience, and I think American readers are mostly terrified that Director Comey will throw America under the bus and cover up your coup.I don’t agree. Here is my take.Before the BBC and the Guardian confirmed my HeatStreet exclusive on the FISA warrant issued in October, I was a lone voice in the wilderness on its existence.(And may history record that our conservative-leaning website had that scoop). When the writer Jason Leopold of Vice asked if Trump had been under investigation in September he got a GLOMAR response: ‘We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of any such records’.GLOMAR responses are named for a submarine and can only be given if a matter of national security is at stake. Mr. Leopold announced he would sue, for why should a concluded investigation be a matter of national security? I told him, with little credibility then and tons now, that the GLOMAR response made sense because there is an ongoing investigation into Mr. Trump and his associates on a matter of national security.Democrats, including Democrats in Obama’s government who ought to know better, have asked if James Comey had ‘a double standard’ over the investigations into Clinton and Trump. Yes; he did, and he does. He may talk about a criminal investigation. He may not talk about a current, ongoing  investigation into espionage, bribery, money laundering and so forth that affects US national security.Over the summer and early autumn Democrats wrongly stated that the FBI / Comey had said they were not looking into Roger Stone and had declined to investigate Roger Stone, who announced his links to Wikileaks. This came from a Senate hearing and Mr. Comey’s testimony to Democrat Rep. Nadler. Rep. Nadler asked if Stone’s boasts constituted special circumstances, Comey said “I don’t think so.”  It must have been frustrating for Comey. He was GLOMAR-ing Congress right to their face and they did not understand what was going on.Subsequently, the heads of NSA, CIA and FBI “Glomar”ed, in no particular order, two Congressional open Russian hack hearings, one closed briefing to the House of Representatives, and in the case of the CIA’s Director Brennan, Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday.Furthermore, although Comey is a natural Republican he appeared to have played it straight. In the summer he cleared Clinton of a criminal standard of negligence. In the fall, he had been sandbagged by Russian moles inside the FBI Field Office in New York. But I do not believe Mr. Comey surrendered wrongly to ‘pressure’. He knew the moles had effective kompromat – the emails your hacker Nikulin planted or woke – and that were he not to revise his testimony in the light of new evidence, his far more important natsec investigation into the traitor, Donald Trump, would be discredited. He then worked around the clock to clear Mrs. Clinton.All evidence shows that James Comey is pursuing your assault on America, Mr. Putin, with the fearless I expect from a counter-intelligence patriot. In June, he named Donald Trump to a FISA court as an agent of Russian influence. In July, he did the same. Both times, the court turned him down. In April, Mr. Comey received audio of Russian money financing Trump – that’s the same time that Paul Manafort joined the campaign to run it. He formed a joint CIA/FBI /Treasury task force to look at the money.Over the summer, US counter-intelligence met with Chris Steele because they had already got their own independent information that he was correct. On October 5th, your hacker Nikulin was picked up on an FBI ‘Red Warrant’ in Prague which means Director Comey had put a top priority on getting him some time before. Armed with whatever Nikulin spilled – and, Mr. Putin, he fainted when they caught him – Director Comey went back again, to a new FISA judge, on October 15, and he got his warrant.Every indication is that Director Comey is not only independent but plays better chess than both you or I, Mr. Putin. (Can I call you VVP? I feel like I know you). For in September, the FBI did not join the ODNI statement about Russia’s intent being to aid Trump. Why not? Because while the NSA and CIA had heard the tapes of Americans in Trump’s camp working with your officials, taking your bribes, disseminating your information, Director Comey had not yet received his warrant. In order not to give Trump’s defense and the defense of his camps anything to go on, the FBI was Caesar’s wife. It did not act on surveillance of US persons abroad offered by the UK, Estonia, BIS, and Lithuania until it got the warrant. Director Comey does not want any ‘fruit of the poisoned tree’ defenses (no pun intended, Mr. Putin, and may I remind you sir that it is bad form to kill one’s opponents in chess. It’s cheating).The FBI ‘changed’ its stance on the final Russian hacking report because they had, by then, listened to the tapes. Legally. Under a warrant.The FBI has, fortunately, always employed the principle of compartmentalization. The FBI Counter-Intelligence division in New York kept their dealings secret from the criminal field office in New York.But, some readers will say, Russian moles in the NSA – OK, it’s a worthy target. Why would the Russians have sleeper moles in a mere FBI criminal field office, even if it is New York?And the answer to that is simple; a corrupt FBI NY Field Office guards the interest of Russian mobsters, allows them to launder their money through Trump’s “failing” casinos and building projects, makes sure that Trump being paid double for a Florida house doesn’t get investigated, allows paedophile Jeffrey Epstein to keep a mansion in New York City,  ensures that Trump’s criminal taxes don’t get investigated, and sits hard enough on the NYPD that Trump can commit crime after crime in plain sight, socializing with the FBI’s most wanted mobsters, and never get charged with a damn thing. It ensures that Manafort and Stone can live in Trump tower, that Cohen’s trips on Russian-Registered private jets get washed. It allows the “FBI” to be next to the media, including the New York Times and Fox news, and act as un-named law enforcement sources. The FBI Field Office in New York wasn’t just infiltrated by your agents to scupper Hillary Clinton, Mr. Putin. It was there to guard the money of your billionaires and to cover the tracks of your handlers in the Russian embassy and consulates. That’s why the dead security guard at the Russian consulate never got investigated. You have a lot of people in New York, and they are very affable, pleasant folks, too. I’ve met a couple.But let’s get back to the game. Your trouble is that Mr. Comey is not for sale. You have nothing on him. Let’s remember your hacker Nikulin, whom Comey was chasing since who knows when. A few days ago Comey picked up another of your hackers in Spain as he was about to board a plane to France with his wife. You yourself, through your propaganda sites, connected this to the DNC hack. You had the identical reaction that you did to Nikulin being picked up. You threw a rather beta male hissy fit. Stanislav Lisov had coded a bank virus. But there’s rather more to it than that. Lisov fits the hacker narrative in the Steele dossier. He needed paying. He has Gazprom connections, and he has a scary interest in satellites, which you, Mr. Putin, would like to weaponize against the United States.But you know, the FBI caught him, none the less. Comey caught him. They know about the US company he formed, how it transferred to Oregon from Florida, and how money was funneled through a failed ‘secretive startup’.The white knight is outplaying the black knight and all his moves indicate that.Is it really worth chronicling the rest of the match? You, Mr. Putin, have relied on big data and on propaganda, including an army of trolls. It is plain to UK intelligence that you have a Russian spy ring at Cambridge University; that you may have combed through and stolen, illegally in the EU, the Facebook data of hundreds of millions of Americans; that you use propagandists SCR and combined GSR and SCR to form Cambridge Analytica; and that you used Twitter’s database to create a bot army.It’s plain from both money and propaganda that Steve Bannon is your tool, your agent of influence; that you work through Nigel Farage and so on; that RT and Sputnik are not merely spy centers, but money-laundering tools; and that you have used ‘Big data’ of Cambridge Analytica (personality types plus propaganda from SCR) to poison the minds of Americans and indeed voters across the West. You have your hackers sitting on 4 Chan, where the ‘prank’ on the Brexit petition involved Russian server addresses.But you are a careless player, Mr. Putin. Scrubbing archive.is of tweets wherein @GenFlynn pushes your hideous propaganda is pretty dumb. Scrubbing Michael Cohen’s phone data is also dumb, when we have him and his daughter waltzing around Europe and the Caribbean in Russian-owned private jets. You live by the troll, sir, then you die by the troll. Your propaganda and how you pay for it is all traceable. America has its hackers, too.The DoJ inquiry has fired the first shots. It’s named Erik Prince. It knows you have the Mercers, it knows about Bannon, it knows about your moles in the NYPD. You see sir it all goes back to Nikulin. The NYPD ‘found’ that laptop on October 3rd.  And on October 5th, Nikulin comes to Prague for payment.But Mr. Putin, James Comey’s friends were waiting there to turn your black pawn into our white queen. And whenever Flynn tweeted Russian agitprop, the FBI and the NSA had a URL.You sir, are like a chess player in possession of all his many, many pieces, but boxed in, in the back row, and despite having them all arrayed on the board – Jeff Sessions as Attorney General even though he recruited the spy Carter Page into your team – despite all of that, none of it will matter. White has you trapped. You and your ally Iran. Checkmate came from the Persian phrase, “Shah Mat”.The King is dead. And I didn’t even have to bother with Sessions, Page, Manafort, Stone, Flynn, and all the SIGINT that we have on them, the deals they made with Wikileaks to receive intel that you hacked and phished and planted with your viruses.Impeachment of Mr. Trump is on the way.What you should ask yourself is if it is in Russia’s and your own best interest for you to keep deceiving an angry America? For when the trials do start, the back-covering, the rage, the scrambling, the desperate need to seem harder on your oligarch friends than the next politician – this could harm not only you and your allies but the next generation of Russian kleptocrats too.It would surely be better to give it up now, release some of that kompromat now, push Trump out, and face the anger of a relieved United States after Trump resigns.But perhaps you cannot.Perhaps Mr. Putin, you have played yourself right into a corner.  After all, those who know what komprat you hold on them also know that you hold it. And they can collaborate with the FBI.Chess is a good game, sir.But the reason Russians are so poor is that you can’t stop playing it."}

It is the day after Brexit, where Russia and Cambridge Analytica had employed similar techniques in BritainJuly 6-8: Carter Page takes tape of Trump promising overturning sanctions for help with hacking to Moscow. There is no FISA warrant on Page in July, but multiple foreign intelligence services, including at least the UK, Ukraine and Germany, had hacked and hot-wired Page’s phone.July 18-22nd: the GOP Convention. Sergei Kislyak is taped offering dirty Russian money to the entire GOP. Reince Priebus and Paul Ryan are among two of those taped accepting it. The FBI places the entire GOP under a RICO investigation. No FISA warrant is needed for these intercepts as U.S. persons were gathered under “incidental collection”“Late July”: – James Comey states his counterintelligence campaign into Trump and Russia begins. It is also a criminal inquiry, he says.Summer: (But on or after late July) The Washington Post exclusively reports that Carter Page is made the subject of a FISA warrant “in the summer”. We cannot say for sure that the warrant was granted in July.Between late July and October, Carter Page doubtless yielded evidence obtained under FISA that servers from Alfa Bank and SVB Bank are instrumental to the hack on the election. Because no warrant is sought on those banks until mid October.October 7th: the DNI reports that the Russian state hacked the DNC, and that this was authorized by the highest levels of the Russian government; and that a ‘private Russian company had breached 22 states voter databases.October 15th: – FISA warrants are granted for “Any US Person” connected to two Russian banks, Alfa and SVB Bank, the latter of which has a deal with Sberbank, suspected of money laundering and financial offenses relating to Trump and RussiaI note with caution, because one author of the Washington Post piece, Ellen Nakashima, has been very wrong before when she uncritically reported as a fact what Mike Pence told her on Mike Flynn – that he was not under FBI investigation – that the Post stated that Page was the only direct FISA named target granted in 2016:If, and I emphasize IF, the Post was correct on that detail, then Manafort is likely to have been under FISA surveillance based on the two FISA warrants I reported on Nov 7th, concerning SVB Bank and Alfa Bank and their servers’ communications with the Trump Tower and Spectrum Health servers (it was in fact one warrant per bank, I have learned). As a reminder, those warrants were issued for “any US person” in respect of the money laundering offenses ascribed to those two banks.The October 15th warrant also allowed the FBI to listen for the first time to the intercepts taken by Five Eyes from Manafort’s phone of the Treasonmeeting on June 9th, and to hear the tapes of Carter Page’s meetings in Moscow in early July, provided by friendly foreign intelligence. My story said:Donald Trump’s tweets would tend to confirm this theory – that the Manafort FISA surveillance was carried out under the warrant covering “any US person” in respect to the money laundering of two Russian banks – with his breathless tweets of March 3rd, in which he stated that just before “the very sacred election [sic]’ “my phones” were tapped. Mr. Manafort lives in Trump Tower.Mr. Trump’s tweets certainly fit with the FISA’s granted on October 15th.Let it be noted that Trump was criminally obstructing justice here, revealing evidence in an ongoing criminal case. I had reported the existence of FISA warrants, not what Director Comey did with them. At that time, I had no knowledge of how Director Comey implemented the permission he received from the court, or on whom.Nov 8th, 2016 – CNN exclusively reported that on election day, the FBI was monitoring how Russia influenced and orchestrated social media accounts to hack the election, this includes Facebook and TwitterDecember 10, 2016 – The Washington Post exclusively reports that the FBI and the CIA differed to lawmakers over Russia’s motivesDecember 16 – five days later, the Washington Post exclusively reports the FBI is now in agreement with the CIA that Russia was trying to help Trump. The authors blame lawmakers for giving them a false report of what took place in the House Intelligence Committee:Sources familiar with events speculated that yet another FISA warrant may have been obtained in December between the House hearing and the report of the 16th, allowing the FBI to examine the packet data, or messaging, transferred between the Spectrum Health server and SVB and Alfa Bank’s two servers. Because the Spectrum server could have been transmitting health data information, these sources say, legal protections were higher for it than for the Trump Tower server.As I exclusively reported, the FBI then discovered that the servers were washing money but also data laundering – targeting the hacked state registration, and DNC Vertical databases, with Cambridge Analytica’s chosen propaganda, and their analytics, to help Mr. Trump cheat his way to the White House.In November, 2016, I broke the story of the FBI’s investigation into Trump and Russia, contradicting the New York Times (and I, not the New York Times, was correct).In that piece, published on the eve of the election, I reported that there was a failed application to the FISA court in June 2016 which named Donald Trump and three of his associates. I later reported exclusively that these names were Boris Epshteyn, Carter Page and Paul Manafort.Some commentators online have suggested my reporting of November was incorrect because a FISA warrant was later granted on Carter Page. However, they were mistaken. The June application on Manafort, Trump, Page and Epshteyn was denied, since it featured Mr. Trump. Sources familiar with the matter have speculated that the tape of Donald Trump that Carter Page took to Moscow, wherein he discusses changing sanctions policy in return for help with hacking the election, may have been recorded without Trump’s consent at the Mayflower Hotel, when all four men were discussing the matter with Sergei Kislyak, Russia’s then Ambassador to the United States. As I exclusively reported, Mr. Kislyak’s phone was hot-miked throughout by an exploit placed upon it by a Five Eyes nation.Indeed, James Comey testified in April that his counter-intelligence operation into the Trump campaign began in late July, 2016. Therefore, no FISA warrant allowing the FBI access to US persons in this respect had been granted in June 2016.Other outlets have reported that Carter Page and Paul Manafort were under prior FISA warrants. However, these warrants need renewal. Because the June application, which included both men along with Epshteyn and Trump was rejected, there was no FISA warrant in place for a Trump-Russia investigation until, per Director Comey, late July.It may be that FISA warrants were granted on both Page and Manafort in late July; we know one was granted on Page in the summer, because of the Washington Post’s exclusive. Late July would post-date Page’s trip to Moscow with the tape of Trump, and coincides with, or immediately post-dates, the GOP Convention, July 18-21 in Cleveland, Ohio.I exclusively reported at Patribotics that Sergei Kislyak was hot-miked at the GOP Convention agreeing to wash money into the GOP; that the entire GOP was thereafter under a RICO case, and that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, was on intercepts with Kislyak agreeing to accept dirty Russian money into the campaign. No FISA warrant would have been needed for this recording, as Ambassador Kislyak is a foreign national. The U.S. persons on those tapes were collected under ‘incidental collection’.It is quite probable therefore that Page certainly, and possibly also Manafort, were directly targeted in a warrant dated “late July” , after the GOP Convention concluded and they were taped with the Ambassador.Although the next story was reported by me earlier, the event it describes was later – October, 2016. Knowing, from the recordings made of Sergei Kislyak at the Convention, that Trump, Ryan and Reince Priebus had all agreed to accept laundered Russian money to assist in hacking and influencing the election, James Comey then sought FISA warrants on how this was being done – through Alfa Bank, which sent Trump Russia’s money, and SVB Bank, which had its own server, communicating with the Trump and Spectrum Health servers, and which sent the Trump campaign the Cambridge Analytica targeting for the hacked state voter databases, which, I exclusively reported, the Trump and Spectrum servers were washing hourly with Alfa Bank.I reported that the two FISA warrants on SVB Bank and Alfa Bank granted by FISC to the FBI to surveil ‘any US person’ in conjunction with financial and banking offenses that connected to Russia were granted in October.Paul Wood of the BBC later clarified that date as October 15th. Wood also confirmed my reporting that the FISA warrants covered Trump and the three associates I later named as Page, Manafort and Epshteyn:McClatchy DC later confirmed Wood’s exclusive that a six-agency financial task force had begun earlier than the FBI’s specific counter-intelligence and criminal investigation; it also confirmed the FISA warrant.I shall have more on what Director Comey described there in a later story.I have, however, also reported that Mr. Manafort’s phone was hot-miked in an exploit placed upon it by GCHQ (other nations had also hacked Mr. Manafort’s phone) and that not only did it record everything at the Treasonmeeting on June 9th, but that the ‘notes’ on Mr. Manafort’s phone were taken from this exploit and that the FBI and Justice Department have those notes and recordings.This complements my prior reporting. Until he obtained his FISA warrant in October on the two banks, Director Comey could not listen to the evidence that other US intelligence agencies had heard long before.However (again), I reported exclusively in the spring that at least six FISA warrants had been granted in Trump-Russia. Sources close to the matter indicate that at the Treasonmeeting, the Russians present used the word ‘adoption’ as fairly obvious code for ‘sanctions’.CNN’s story may inadvertently mislead readers, although it is correct in its reporting as written. It states:That is precisely right, but GCHQ and other allied nations were listening, and once a broader FISA warrant was obtained, this recorded evidence was passed to the FBI. The notes taken from Mr. Manafort’s phone were also obtained from this same exploit. Precisely like Sergei Kislyak, Paul Manafort, had he only known it, was ‘wearing a wire’ throughout the 2016 campaign. The FBI only reviewed that evidence once a FISA warrant covering Manafort was obtained. CNN’s story says of the audio that exists in that respect:I am not sure whether CNN’s sources have filled them in on, or are aware, of the entire picture. But I note that in December – which is after October, as the eagle-eyed among you will note – the FBI suddenly appeared to “change its mind” over whether Russian hacking into the election, propaganda warfare, and so on, was done to benefit Donald Trump directly.  Having not joined the CIA and NSA in their assessment of this, the FBI suddenly turned around and said “Yes, we agree the Russians were trying to help Donald Trump”.This is because, sources with knowledge believe, without certainty, that a further FISA warrant was obtained in December for the FBI to examine evidence the NSA had provided on encrypted communications, passed by iodine Xfer transfer, between the Russian bank servers and servers within Trump Tower and Spectrum Health, the company connected to Betsy De Vos and her brother Erik Prince. That was a refinement of the October warrant, because a health care company was used by the traitors since health data has high levels of protection under US law. To examine the packets – what was being sent to Moscow – the FBI had to demonstrate to the FISC court, which they successfully did in December, that what was being sent back and forth was not in fact ‘health data’ on Americans, but rather was encrypted messages between the traitors of the Trump campaign and their paymasters in Moscow.As soon as that FISA warrant was granted, and James Comey was able legally to read the messages that the CIA and NSA already knew about, the FBI “suddenly” changed its mind on Russia’s intentions with Trump. As I reported on Nov 7th, 2016, when breaking the story of the FBI’s investigation into Trump and Russia, Director Comey was always concerned from the start of his work to ensure that criminal prosecutions had a basis of evidence that was legally obtained and legally read by the FBI."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8f4db6510aa000b74c"},"text":"On June 9th at Trump Tower, Russian intelligence and the Trump team met to receive intelligence from the Russian government detrimental to Hillary Clinton. This was arranged by Donald Trump Jr, who, in publishing his emails with Russian intelligence, has admitted to conspiracy to collude in the election; as has Jared Kushner, whose statement, while openly admitting to breaking the Logan Act, does not mention the email subject.As I exclusively reported for Patribotics, GCHQ has complete recordings of the meeting from the hot-miced phones of several Russians, whose phones were hacked before they landed in the United States. It is safe to assume the USIC (United States Intelligence Community) also has these recordings.However, we can extrapolate that complex negotiations over how Trump and Russia should collude to hack the election were not finalized at this meeting, as it was simply not long enough.I believe there was a second meeting, at which the deal was done. June 24th, in Scotland, the day after the Brexit vote, Donald Trump, members of his family and various press barons and Russian actors met in Scotland at Trump’s golf course.After this meeting, Trump’s fortunes changed rapidly. He arrived in Scotland broke, with his campaign deep in debt, and his polling numbers an embarrassment. Just days after he departed, the Trump campaign was flooded with money – and Russian bots, previously dedicated to Brexit, began to retarget themselves to Trump.Trump and his co-conspirators can rest assured – although this may be the wrong way to put it – that GCHQ will have had this entire weekend on tape.If hacking for money and sanctions, and other deals favoring press barons, were washed at this meeting, conspirators – such as Steve Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary – need to be aware that GCHQ will have them on tape and will have passed those tapes to the USIC and Special Counsel Mueller.Sources with links to British intelligence have confirmed there is plenty of SIGINT on this meeting in Scotland. When Trump went to Scotland, he had, in terms of votes, clinched, the nomination, but but the GOP convention was some time away. What Trump didn’t have was organization and money.Immediately after the June 24 effort, two things started to happen even to the casual observer. Trump became flush with money, and the bot accounts that had pushed Brexit repurposed to target Trump and Putin’s other secondary allies across Europe, in activity that was coordinated by Mike Flynn.Steve Mnuchin came to the campaign (officially) in May. It was reported to have just $1.3m at the start of June but $51m by the end of the month.the fact is though Mnuchin had been doing a lousy job until mid-June, although his friend Geoff Palmer had given Trump a couple of million that month.Mr. Mnuchin sent Trump fundraising emails to UK members of Parliament – it is illegal to raise election money off foreign nationals.On June 30th, Mnuchin gave $425,000 to the Trump Victory PAC.  Let’s look at the PACs for a minute. Were they ways to launder money to Trump? The record suggests that the PACs were set up in advance of Treasonmeetings 1 and 2, June 9th and June 24th, so that bad actors from China and Russia could promise Trump money funneled through these PACs. Mnuchin would have criminal responsibility if this indeed occurred.From researcher and former trader Louise Neu comes news of two PACs that appear to have funneled illegal money to Trump:Great America PAC, a donor to Trey Gowdy SCRebuilding America Now PAC, with Tom Barrack and Geoff Palmer.Great America PAC was caught on tape by the UK Telegraph newspaper agreeing to funnel Chinese money to Trump and to trade Presidential influence for it when Trump won.Rebuilding America Now PAC links to Barrack and Palmer, who had Chinese money ties and fines for improper use of PACs respectively. Weird, non-round amounts in the donations and refunds from these PACs suggested money laundering.Geoff Palmer, a principal in Rebuilding America Now PAC, had previously been fined for money laundering. The method? Fake donations that were then refunded, according to Politico:Now who is this LA developer’s partner? Tom Barrack, who is bringing Chinese money into real estate in LA. It is also run by two Paul Manafort and Rick Gates loyalists, who have worked directly with the campaign. Now we have Russian, through Manafort, and Chinese money that appears to be laundered. Tom Barrack headed the Inaugural Committee, many donations to which appear to be money-laundering shell donations.But let us recall that Mr. Palmer had laundered money through reimbursements before. Ms. Neu found that donations made to Rebuilding America Now PAC were in odd amounts, and that refunds were given in the amounts these odd numbers added up to.Therefore, Trump Victory, Rebuilding America Now and Great America PAC, under this theory, laundered foreign money into Donald Trump’s campaign on a wholesale level. $107m in the Inaugural Committee’s money laundering and of course more beforehand.So why did the Treasonmeetings matter? Well, did Mnuchin promise Trump he’d bring on Geoff  ‘The Laundromat’ Palmer?Mnuchin was accused of taking $3m in Madoff money, but won the case. He also was sued by Trump in 2008 over Trump Tower Chicago for Dune Capital. The case was “settled on unknown terms”. Fake lawsuits have often proved to be simple money laundering devices.What were the terms?Also, Trump “loaned himself” money and then forgave the loans, the public record suggested. But did he really give that money to his own campaign?Again, Mr. Mnuchin will have legal criminal liability for any foreign money laundering into Trump’s campaign. He should know that if he discussed anything illegal, he is on tape.Barcadad also points me to Bitcoin, the official Trump-Russia money laundering currency, SOARING in unrepeatable donations to Trump. After June 24th, the Treasonmeeting, Bitcoin donations to Trump that were unreportable – under $100 – soared.I reported exclusively in April that Mike Flynn had coordinated Russian propaganda across Europe on behalf of Vladimir Putin. This propaganda was not only to benefit Donald Trump but also the Nazi rabble supported by Putin across Europe, including Marine Le Pen, Viktor Orban and others.It was recently confirmed in the mainstream media that Mike Flynn had amended his disclosures to show he took money from SCL, the propaganda arm of Cambridge Analytica.Cambridge Analytica had worked with Arron Banks and Nigel Farage on Brexit. Flynn’s propaganda derived from Russia – we now know that SCL was creating the content. This ties Cambridge Analytica and SCL inexorably to Donald Trump.Dan Scavino, Trump’s social media manager, was there. He relentlessly co-ordinated with Russia. I will report separately upon his part in Trump-Russia. The SCL propaganda floated by Cambridge Analytica and pushed by Flynn for Russia was coordinated through Scavino. This evidence found by researcher Kelly @Kelly2277. Treasonmeeting 1 anti-Browder, anti-sanctions lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was in the UK June 24th, posting from the Hard Rock cafe at 3:30 pm. And so were her Treasonmeeting 1 co-conspirators Rob Goldstone and Emin Agalarov. I’m indebted to researcher Brett @BBTRX for the find.I am indebted to Team Patriot for the research in this story. They selflessly answered the call. Links to more individual accounts will be added here later tonight; I am publishing the story first the hopes of getting it out."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8f4db6510aa000b74d"},"text":"Yesterday we published part one of the Cliff Notes to Treason: A short guide on what SIGINT US allies have on which parts of Trump’s team. Many of the principals in the Trump Russia effort are listed in that piece.As previously, I emphasize that all of this is sourced from various people with links to the intelligence communities of various nations. It is not meant to exclude further SIGINT that patribotics does not know about.Various hostile intelligence agencies have SIGINT on Kushner; the UK and US recorded him in the Russian Embassy when he was discussing his ‘back channel’ to Russia. The Russian Embassy to the United States in Washington D.C. is Russian sovereign territory. Although the UK is barred by the Five Eyes agreement from spying on US soil, the Russian Embassy is not US soil. Again I remind readers of my exclusive report that Sergei Kislyak’s phone was hot miked and was recording everybody it came into contact with.At least the UK and the USA have Prince on SIGINT. He was intimately connected with the Carolina Conspiracy and with the Alfa Bank and Spectrum Health servers. The ‘back channel’ to Russia is those servers. Prince was deeply involved with the Carolina Conspiracy.Is on SIGINT by the USA and UK in relation to the use of the Spectrum Health server. It is important to say here that Ms. De Vos herself is a suspect, according to my sources with links to the intelligence community.The daughter of Vladimir Putin. She heads an endocrinology charity. Michigan’s facility, where the Spectrum Health server was located, is an endocrinology center. I reported in my Nov 7th 2016 report on the two FISA warrants, which Naveed Jamali publicly tweeted he was a source for, that Putin’s own daughters were involved in the activities of the server.As a Russian, Deripaska is on SIGINT with multiple foreign allies including the UK and France. Mr. Deripaska particularly hates Hillary Clinton, who denied his visa to America in 2009. I reported some of this SIGINT in my recent piece about Sheriff Clarke being taped in Russia with associates of Deripaska, ordered to attack Black Lives Matter. Mr. Deripaska runs many assets in the United States, in the media. He is on SIGINT over the Carolina Conspiracy, as are some of his associates who are American. He is on SIGINT over Putin’s daughters and the Alfa and Spectrum servers.Jack PosobiecMr. Posobiec, sources with links to US intelligence report, is a Russian agent of influence who has been working with Rebel Media. He boasted of publishing the “Macron Leaks” that turned out to be fake. France’s DGSE, or CIA equivalent, hacked Rebel Media’s server in Canada. They discovered material relating to the Carolina Conspiracy that forced the Comey letter. They have all Mr. Posobiec’s communications with Erik Prince, Oleg Deripaska’s agents in the media in the USA, and Team Treason as well as Sputnik and various hackers.Sources were not specific about who precisely is implicated in France’s wholesale lift of Rebel Media’s servers, but indicated that the net is pretty broad, and that more or less everybody in Trump Russia is involved.Sources report that Rebel Media was involved as Russia’s agents of influence in the Carolina Conspiracy that forced James Comey’s letter. All of the subsequent intelligence from those servers has gone to the USIC, sources report. This forms a companion piece to France’s recordings of Donald Trump Jr. talking to Russian agents in France before his father was inaugurated.Mr. Manafort was taped by Estonia in April discussing how Russian money could be washed into Donald Trump’s campaign. I am waiting for permission to report more on Mr. Manafort, who proved a rich vein of SIGINT especially on Mike Pence.As I reported, Carter Page took a tape of Donald Trump to Moscow promising policy shifts in exchange for hacking help.In my last piece I discussed which nations hold SIGINT on Page. Ukraine and Germany both directly hacked Page’s phone. I do not know if they were able to hot-mike it. Germany holds a treasure trove of Carter Page SIGINT, because they are not bound by the Five Eyes agreement.The United Kingdom also has recordings of Carter Page in Moscow discussing the hacking of the election with Sechin, Diveykin and others. The Five Eyes agreement prevents the UK from directly hacking Americans abroad without a legal arrangement with the USA, such as a request and a FISA warrant. However, the UK routinely records Russians inside the Kremlin and their boardrooms. UK surveillance on the Russian end, both official and by private firms, captured everything Page said in Russia, and captured him playing the tape of Mr. Trump’s words, sources said.More of our ground-breaking reporting:"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8f4db6510aa000b74e"},"text":"Exclusive: According to sources with links to the Justice Department and intelligence community, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein was ordered by Russian hacking suspect, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to write two separate memos regarding Director Comey; one that argued for Comey’s strengths as FBI Director and the second, which Sessions used in his obstruction of justice to fire Director Comey.This means that it is Jeff Sessions who is directly responsible for obstructing justice by misusing Rosenstein’s pro and con Comey memos, and not Donald Trump. The Deputy Attorney General made a point of saying that even in his ‘negative’ memo, he would not recommend that Donald Trump fire Director Comey. On the night James Comey was fired by Trump, using the Sessions memos, Rosenstein had to be persuaded not to resign himself, so angered was he that Jeff Sessions had tricked him and misused only one of his two memos.However, DAG Rosenstein was persuaded that it would be madness to resign and allow a right-wing partisan loyal to Trump, and only confirmed on a party-line vote, take his position overseeing the inquiry. Sessions had been forced to recuse, and the game was now to eliminate Rosenstein. Instead, the Deputy Attorney General immediately appointed Special Counsel Mueller, and left any decisions on recusals to him.As I reported on Twitter at the time, both Andy McCabe and Rod Rosenstein had Director Comey’s full confidence – and they still do.The concerted effort to concoct a forced recusal – which will not happen – is seen by sources as a push from Russian interests using selected commentators in the US media, some of whom may not realize they are being used in this way, because only one of the Rosenstein “Comey Memos” was ever used (and abused) by Jeff Sessions.Sources say that the USIC has indeed long been playing a game of chess with Mr. Putin. Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham confirmed Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, these sources say, deliberately in order to trap both Trump and Sessions. Both men were well aware of the “conflicts” Sessions had with Russia, and Senator McCain, who gave to US intelligence a much fuller version of the Steele Dossier, in particular, knew some of the reported signals intelligence on meetings Sessions had had with pro-Russian lobbyists. By confirming Sessions as Attorney General they removed him from the Russia inquiry, and this was deliberate.Sources with links to the intelligence community report deep anger at what is seen as a push by the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who has both close ties to Vladimir Putin and funds PR companies in the United States, to push for the forced “recusal” of DAG Rosenstein on spurious grounds that he is a “witness” to obstruction of justice by Donald Trump. Donald Trump tried to boost the flagging  ‘recusal’ narrative in the mainstream media by tweeting:Of course, this is exactly the tactic Trump tried to use against Judge Curiel in the Trump University case. Trump tried to catfish Curiel into recusal by tweets and abuse:The pattern of calling bias, adding insults and generally creating smoke in order to remove a ‘troublesome priest’ is both annoying and ineffective, Justice Department sources say. Sources pointed out that DAG Rosenstein had already set out the legally correct position – he would recuse himself if Mueller, not Trump, decided he needed to do so. Thus, any recusal would only be determined by the Special Counsel.It is plain to see that Mr. Trump would always be able to cherry-pick Justice Department and other third branch personnel if he were able to force them into recusal merely by picking a quarrel with them, these sources say. Special Counsel Mueller is unmoved by media parlor games incited by Mr. Deripaska, who is currently, whether he knows it or not, under the spotlight by the United States Intelligence Community, who resent Putin’s ongoing attempted intervention in their work."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8f4db6510aa000b74f"},"text":"Exclusive: Sources familiar with James Comey’s thinking say that today’s explosive testimony was planned in advance as part of the counterintelligence operation against Russia’s attack on the United States.James Comey knew in advance he was going to be fired, these sources say, when Trump threatened him. At that point, the Director set in place countermeasures to protect the FBI”s investigation from Trump’s interference.These included discussions with future key players at the Department of Justice and the FBI, these sources say, including Acting Director McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein.It was further anticipated by Director Comey, these sources say, that the Trump team would both try to access FBI data and pass it to Russian intelligence. As we earlier reported exclusively, data from Director Comey’s computer was both taken by the Trump Team and passed to the Russians. The property of the United States was then recovered, these sources say. Separate sources with links to the Justice Department say, without being definitive, that it is thought that Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an IT ‘audit’ of Director Comey’s electronics, and so the data may have been lawfully collected in a way that would not raise suspicions. Removable media containing data from Director Comey’s computer was then passed to the Russians, sources with links to the intelligence community confirm, adding that the said data has been recovered.Director Comey anticipated further both that Donald Trump would boast he had tapes on him, and that he, Comey, would be called to Congress to give the sensational testimony he has given today under oath. Comey is highly sensitized to the value of television and the news cycle, sources familiar with his thinking say. He had reluctantly become so, after understanding the crucial role the data laundering of Donald Trump played in the election. Comey therefore decided to wait until his live televised hearing to reveal some of his knowledge about the Russian hacking investigation to the public in order that its impact not be diminished. Indeed, with partisans of both parties seeking to blame Comey for their failures, the Director had become convinced that if he were not dismissed the investigation might focus too much on him and not enough on the foreign and domestic enemies of the United States. While he was angered at the manner of his firing, sources report, Director Comey regarded the situation with the dispassionate eye of a chess player sacrificing a rook to back his opponent into a corner. Both Donald Trump and his Russian handlers fell into line, up to and including their concentration on lines in yesterday’s written testimony, which catfished Russian partisans into repeating ‘obstruction of justice’ until the concept was firmly affixed in the public’s mind. This left Comey open to detailing how Trump obstructed justice without using the term, today.Director Comey was able to tell the public, using the GLOMAR technique, that both Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions are under criminal investigation for treason with Russia, and that both obstructed justice. Such a killer blow could not have been dealt – at least not so easily – had Trump and his Russian allies had the good sense to leave Director Comey to do his job."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d8f4db6510aa000b750"},"text":"On Nov 7th, the eve of the election, I published at Heat Street a detailed story on a FISA warrant* granted against two Russian banks.This story was a world exclusive. It was also given to me just before the election and published when it could make no real difference to the outcome.What it could do, however, was warn bad actors involved with the two banks that they were now under investigation by the FBI. At the time of reporting, I did not even myself understand exactly what a FISA warrant meant, nor its extreme secrecy.The FISA warrant was confirmed by Paul Wood of the BBC in a lengthy and detailed exclusive on Russia two months later.As a journalist I will always protect my sources. If, however, a source wishes to broadcast publicly that they were a source, that is a freedom of speech, first amendment issue that is up to them.Even under pressure, and after quarreling with Mr. Jamali, I have never revealed him as a source. Had he not decided to tweet that he was a source, I would remain under that obligation today.I stood up my story with a second source whose identity is unknown to Mr. Jamali. The journalist Lloyd Grove at the Daily Beast, who wrote a hit piece on me attempting to debunk the FISA and Trump Russia stories, just before Director Comey admitted Trump was being investigated, said to me he needed to “put it to me” that the former CIA agent and hero Evan McMullin was a source, because that is what Naveed Jamali told him. Jamali has also repeatedly tweeted that my source was the 20 year veteran of the NSA John Schindler.Both of those allegations are total lies. They are the more dishonorable, because Mr. Jamali knows perfectly well that he himself was a FISA warrant source.Last week, Jamali misread one of my tweets, in which I denied that Evan McMullin was a source of mine. Mr. McMullin has never been a source of mine on any story whatsoever, for the avoidance of doubt. He is a patriot, who would no sooner leak classified intelligence than he would fly to the moon.The FISA court operates in secrecy. After a Presidential election, there is a transition team with access to its information. Before the election, there are fewer people with access. Mr. Jamali is (I think) still a reservist in Naval intelligence. He was highly unlikely to have had access to the detailed information that I published on November 7th. He told me, for this story, who his own sources were. I have described whom Jamali alleged told him his information in a formal report to the FBI. (I believe that allegation to be sensitive and will not publish it. ) I could not, and would not, have been able to make this report, without his actual public admission on Twitter, which released me from my obligation of confidentiality towards him.Previously, Jamali had tweeted that he began talking to me about the FISA court in the summer (false) but that he had passed on ‘rumor’.  This would seem to be not legal for a serving reservist in intelligence, but Jamali tweeted that this is what he had done.Mr. Grove, for his Daily Beast piece, said to me that Jamali had said he was my source but described it as ‘gossip and rumor’. At around that time, Jamali was admitting only to often talking to me about FISA in the summer, however, and was, in essence, denying he was the source for the story.  It is a matter of public record, as I told Grove, that if Jamali was (as he earlier claimed) passing on ‘gossip and rumor’ about FISA in the summer, that I did not publish such ‘gossip and rumor’. The date on my story, which is detailed, accurate, and which has since been verified by the BBC, is November 7th – the eve of the election, and far away in time from ‘the summer’.No matter what revolting disinformation was being pushed on McMullin and Schindler, nonetheless, I was not going to reveal a source who did not choose to be revealed, at any price. However, Mr. Jamali misread a tweet in which I denied Evan McMullin was my source. Jamali thought that, instead, I had denied that HE was my source, and did one of his patented emoticons as he insisted that I should give him his full props for being a ‘double agent’ and a FISA warrant source. Mr. Jamali has never been an agent of either America or of Russia, but when he insists that he was a source for my FISA warrant story, I am certainly happy enough to validate his public tweeting on that matter. * subsequent information has now come to light that there were two warrants, one per bank, granted on the same day. Paul Wood of the BBC reported exclusively that the date they were granted was October 15th.More of our reporting:"}

They further report that ‘removable media’ was used in the commission of this crime. ‘Removable media’ is a category describing physical devices that can be placed into a computer, either to download information or to upload it, such as a memory card, a USB stick, a removable hard drive, a thumb drive or similar items.Sources further report that a person or persons allied to Donald Trump passed data accessed from Director Comey’s computer to Russian diplomats. It is not known when or how this took place. A piece of removable media containing all the data in question has been recovered from hostile actors, sources say, and is now in the possession of the Justice Department.Director Comey is said to have known in advance that Mr. Trump would dismiss him. He took careful steps, these sources say, to leave not only a paper trail as we have seen in the story of the ‘Comey Memo’ but also a digital one. Director Comey’s own primary work computer, and other computers in and around his former office, were fitted with sophisticated intelligence community software allowing the Justice Department to see precisely how and when they were attacked.The official Foreign Ministry of Russia’s Twitter account posted a tweet showing Foreign Minister Lavarov laughing with Rex Tillerson, the Secretary of State who has won the Order of Friendship of Vladimir Putin, over Director Comey’s firing, on the day Donald Trump hosted the Russians in the White House and verbally gave them top-secret allied intelligence, later published by the Russian news agency Tass.White House sources say Trump has already discussed his resignation more than once. Perhaps when he discovers that the justice and intelligence communities are well aware he breached Director Comey’s computer and handed FBI data to Russia, he may decide to spare the nation further trauma and resign.If he becomes President, Mike Pence will be unable to pardon Donald Trump for any crimes at the state level.More on this story as we receive it.————————————————–\n\nShare this:TweetEmailWhatsAppMore\n\n\u0009Related"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d904db6510aa000b752"},"text":"Several separate sources with links to the intelligence communities of more than one nation, and with links within the US state and federal justice systems, have outlined  evidence that exists against multiple men in the line of succession to the US Presidency, as it relates to Russia’s hack on America. I can also exclusively report  a RICO case is being considered against the Republican party for laundering Russian money.These sources say that Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who was the ‘Designated Survivor’ at the inauguration of Donald Trump (yes, really) is likely to become President if charges are pursued, according to the evidence, of illegal collusion with Russia, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.On Donald Trump there is voluminous evidence he knowingly colluded with the Russian state in the hacking of the U.S election, and laundered Russian money through shell companies. This evidence is both data-based, for example, based on the way the server he registered laundered stolen voter registration databases with the DNC’s Vertica database in order to target Russian propaganda at voters.He has additionally both directly obstructed justice and conspired with others to do so. Rather than repeat previous reporting in this piece I will devote a separate article to the case against Mr. Trump.On Mike Pence, there is evidence that he obstructed justice, conspired to obstruct justice, and knew that General Mike Flynn was co-ordinating Russia’s propaganda message on behalf of a foreign power. Pence also violated the Logan Act and obstructed justice when he conspired with Donald Trump to order General Flynn illegally to discuss the removal of sanctions while Barack Obama was still President, and that Pence, Trump and Flynn did so to undermine the action a sitting President was taking against a foreign adversary, as President Obama was expelling Russian spies. I do not mean in this list to exclude evidence of Pence’s espionage, sedition and money-laundering offenses which may have happened during the campaign; it is rather that sources have been more explicit as to Pence’s constitutional and legal violations around President Obama’s actions against Russia, conspiring with Trump to undermine the President of the United States in his action against a foreign adversary.On Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, normally third in the line of succession, I can report as fact that sources say that Ryan has been legally intercepted, and is on tape, admitting that he knew Russian money was being laundered into the Republican party. Without co-operation pending resignation Ryan may find himself swept up into a RICO prosecution involving the apparatus of the Republican party who accepted laundered Russian money.This report is a clarification of what I have previously said I had heard on Twitter; namely that Ryan himself was taped at the Republican convention talking to Sergei Kislyak accepting Russian money into the campaign. Following the unconstitutional dismissal of patriot FBI Director Comey by Sessions and Trump,  sources have become more forthcoming. It was, they say, Reince Priebus who was taped talking to Sergei Kislyak and other Russians at the convention, agreeing to accept laundered or disgused Russian contributions, and Speaker Ryan is on a later intercept admitting that he knew of this plot, which places him at risk of a large number of criminal charges. A RICO case is being examined against the GOP itself, sources say.The fourth person in the line of succession is Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, as President pro-tem of the Senate. Sources with links to the intelligence community say they do not know of any collusion by Hatch in either money-laundering or in accepting Russian intelligence; this does not mean, they warn, that such evidence does not exist.Some readers have expressed dismay that President Trump may use his powers of pardon to escape justice by pardoning his own confederates in their crimes. Several, separate sources with links to both the intelligence and justice communities note that any person or candidate who accepted laundered donations through banks with branches in Wall Street (even if they are from, say, Wisconsin) is liable to charges from New York’s state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. Further, it is understood that the FBI and Federal Prosecutors are working on multiple sets of charges both carefully and individually. Were Mr. Trump to pardon General Flynn for violating the Logan Act, as one example, Flynn would have to accept he committed the crime and Trump would thereby admit his own guilt, leading to impeachment. Prosecutors might then bring separate, subsequent cases against Flynn for RICO, violations of FARA, lying to the FBI, lying on his SF-86, and so forth. At the same time, state courts, where Trump has no powers of pardon, would proceed against Flynn on money laundering crimes, and obstruction of justice charges against Trump might be laid out by Federal prosecutors before the Senate. Violation of the Logan Act is one charge against Flynn which applies to both Trump and Pence, and some lawyers read the power of Presidential pardon as not to apply to cases involving a President’s own impeachment.Following the unconstitutional firing of FBI Director James Comey, I am reporting, in the summary above, on at least some of the evidence that, sources say, exists on several men in the line of succession. This brief report is designed to allow whistleblowing staffers on Capitol Hill, and others, to discuss these matter, relying on a previously published report. Normally, perhaps, blogs would not give sufficient cover, but as Press Secretary Sean Spicer has spent several minutes reading my work aloud from the White House press podium, in order falsely to characterize it, the White House can now hardly object if whistleblowers decide to cite patribotics now.For these reasons, there will be a separate report summarizing some of the evidence that, sources say, exists on figures within the Trump campaign and the Trump administration who are not part of the Presidential line of succession later, as well as a third detailing some of the offenses sources say Donald Trump has himself committed.If whistleblowers wish to contact patribotics they are encouraged to get in touch on Twitter or via the contact form elsewhere on this site."}

Sources indicate that Nunes recommended Ellis for the White House national security post.Yesterday it was reported that Nunes’ friend Mr. Ellis, described as his “close aide”, only started working for the White House this month, when leaks started.If indeed Mr. Ellis did pass on information about the FISA evidence on money laundering, possibly involving Epshteyn, to Nunes, asking him to leak it to the press or allowing him to do so, it would be highly illegal conduct.Mr. Nunes and Mr. Ellis should immediately answer to the rest of the Committee, as to whether anything of the sort occurred, and Mr. Nunes should be hauled before the FBI for the crimes he is committing in plain sight."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d904db6510aa000b754"},"text":"Sources linked to the intelligence community say that Donald Trump accepted laundered Russian money which, through shell companies, supported Russian hackers as they attacked America – and then supported Wikileaks and Julian Assange as he published the results of those hacks.Donald Trump’s link to the hack on the US election appears to be far more direct than anybody thought – with Russian money, washed into his campaign, paying for Russian hackers who attacked both state voter registration databases and the DNC. Trump also appears to have had direct personal knowledge of the propaganda botnet used by Russia.As I previously reported exclusively on Patribotics in three earlier pieces, the first of which was an exclusive by Laurelai Bailey, Peter Chayanov (one of his many aliases) is a Russian hacker who owns a hacking and spamming company called Hostkey. Upon being outed on Twitter by myself, Bailey and @OpFerguson, Chayanov deleted his account.Hostkey was revealed firstly to have provided Wikileaks servers in Russia one week before the DNC emails were published, and secondly, to have been given Wikileaks SSL keys, allowing the tracking of any readers of the site, and allowing Putin to deanonymize any past or present leakers or whistleblowers who supplied Julian Assange with documents.This, of course, makes Assange far more than a publisher – he is now a supplier of intelligence to the Russian state.However, I also reported exclusively here that Hostkey had provided the “servers from a Russian company” which the USIC stated on Oct 7th, 2016, had attacked voter registration databases in American states. Hostkey, Russia and Chayanov were therefore directly linked to Vladimir Putin, and had both hacked and published material on Russia’s behalf.I further reported exclusively that the Alfa Bank – Trump Tower server link was “washing” both the state voter databases and data from the DNC’s “Vertica” database.Today, however, I can also report that Ocean Way Capital, in Florida, which is the shell company that itself hosts Hostkey.com and all its servers, is linked to Russian-Ukranian money laundering to Donald Trump via a series of shell companies based in the British Virgin Islands. Ocean Way Capital Corporation was dissolved there along in April 24th, 2016 – around the same time that, according to the BBC’s Paul Wood, the then director of the CIA heard a tape from Estonian intelligence about Russian money being laundered to the Trump campaign.Ocean Way Capital Corporation (linked to Chayanov directly) was the owner of hostkey.ru.And in August of 2016, Ocean Way Capital LLC, the owner of hostkey.com, was set up in Florida. Other shell companies mentioned in the BVI Gazette of April 2016 included Ontera, a fake company that laundered millions in Russian-Cypriot money; Fortune Trump Holdings and three other Trump companies, including these two: Trump Overseas Ltd and Trump Star Investments Ltd. Run either through google, however, and no, zero, real records come up, either using “Ltd” or “Limited”. We do get this odd looking thing: The apparently fake shell companies sit in the listing alongside another, Ontera, which according to an exclusive report by a Czech investigative journalist, was a fake company used solely to wash Russian money through Cypriot banks.For now, however, let us return to how Ocean Way Capital Corporation links to both Hostkey, and to Russians, the Seychelles and Cyprus.The registrant address of Ocean Way Capital Corporation links to a company found in the Panama Papers..This in turn, links to a web of companies including Moscrip Limited in the Seychelles, where Erik Prince is said to have met a Russian agent with links to Vladimir Putin. It is also linked to Istanova Investments a Cypriot company that appears to trace to Oleg Deripaska and members of his family. More importantly, one holding company linked to the registrant address of Ocean Way Capital Corporation traces back to a Russian national, registered the UK – Sergey Ovchinnikov. He is listed at the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is listed along with a Cypriot. Cyprus and Russia are notorious, of course for money laundering. Lastly: oh google, you are too kind."}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5ab19d904db6510aa000b755"},"text":"It is very important to correct things that are wrong. I have two major corrections to make to my theory, articulated in this story, following Anthony Weiner’s guilty plea to one count of transferring obscene material to a minor and also of “attempting” to do so. The first is that Weiner did indeed, by his own account and that of prosecutors, transfer sexual material to a minor. The plea deal document said this happened ‘in 2016’. Therefore, all the following must be true, and I was wrong about them: Weiner did sext with a minor; the case was not invented, there was a real crime, with a real girl.That is a fact. This article was a theory, written as such. And that theory has been proven partly wrong by the facts, which I must acknowledge with prominence. There was a real crime and a very serious one.No 15 year old girl should ever have to undergo abusive contact by a predator like Weiner. Nor is she in any way whatsoever responsible for any actions by other adults. She is a pure victim.The second thing I want to correct in this story is my blame on ADA Dana Boente.  President Obama removed him from the line of succession. This now appears to have been a clever and successful feint into trapping Trump into reappointing Boente. He clearly has the trust of Director Comey and DUSA Rosenstein, and therefore has mine. I apologize fulsomely to him.As far as the rest of the story goes, it is vital to emphasize, and I do, that if men pretended that they were an abuse victim, that is on them and them alone. Such actions, showing intent, would add to Weiner’s guilt and not diminish it. If grown men faked any thing, as coming from an underage victim of crime, that, again, is on them, and not in any way whatsoever on the victim of the crime.I also want to be clear, however, that I am not correcting, or altering, my overall theory in this article on Trump and Russia. I believe based on all the evidence that Mr. Weiner also sexted and emailed with grown men who were not the real girl he factually abused, but whom he thought were that same girl.I believe, based on the evidence of the indictment by the FBI of Nikulin in Federal Court in October 2016, that he used Formspring to plant a virus on Anthony Weiner’s computer and sway the election. From none of that do I resile. Weiner is a predator and a true crime took place with an underage victim. That does not exclude the rest of these events happening, and the FBI charge of Nikulin supports it. Thus, the thrust of the theory of a conspiracy in South Carolina, by hackers allied with Donald Trump and with Russia, to enable the seizure of Weiner’s computer, and to throw the election, remains. The fact is this conspiracy was enabled by a real offense of Weiner’s, it appears from his plea in court (as best I understand it). I have altered the text below to reflect the reality of that predatory offense.Did Russia use a criminal case against Anthony Weiner – so their hacker Nikulin could plant Hillary’s emails on his computer?It was the Comey letter that handed the election to Trump. Even if corrupt elements in the FBI Field Office in New York, penetrated by Russia, forced Comey’s hand –  even if Russian hacker Nikulin did plant emails on Anthony Weiner’s computer – there had to be a separate criminal case in the first place for the NYPD and FBI to go looking. I thought there was not – as above, I was wrong.Did Vladimir Putin direct an attack  by a hardened group of adult hackers from North Carolina who penetrated the emails of Director Brennan of the CIA, and doxed and attacked hundreds of FBI and law enforcement personnel?In this story I exclusively report the connections between the USSR-CWA hacker group of North Carolina ‘Crackas With Attitude’ and the sexts with, ostensibly, a 15 year old girl from Gaston, North Carolina, who had early in 2016 been a genuine victim of Weiner’s predatory behavior. That started the chain of events that led to James Comey’s forced letter to Congress, including the fact that the an email to Weiner ostensibly written by his earlier victim  is in fact a series of plagiarized texts it is unlikely any 15 year old girl has read, including works by J.D. Salinger, David Foster Wallace, Charles Bukowski, and – yes – “Fight Club” by Chuck Palahniuk.There is also direct evidence that members of the Trump campaign were involved in this conspiracy and knew in advance what was coming – including Lara Trump, who visited Gaston, North Carolina, some days before she promised an ‘October surprise’ and ’tricks up our sleeve.’Russia, I believe, manipulated chain of events that forced James Comey’s letter to Congress. All available data shows that it was the timing of this letter that handed the election to Donald Trump. On November 3rd, just before the election, the Russian plane MKATE and Putin’s bagman Rybolovev met Donald Trump’s campaign plane on the tarmac at Charlotte, North Carolina. By that time, events in North Carolina had swung the election to Mr. Trump.In my first piece of work at Patribotics I laid out a unified theory on Russian active measures against the United States, including as part of it that Russia has a team of influencers inside the FBI Field Office in New York (the criminal division) and I regret to say, the NYPD, who work directly with Rudy Giuliani and General Flynn.I drew readers’ attention to the arrest in Prague of the Russian hacker, Yvgeny Nikulin. He was indicted on charges of hacking Dropbox, Linked in and Formspring in 2012-2013.Formspring is the little-known sexting app that Anthony Weiner used for his sexting the first time around.My theory was that Nikulin, on instructions from the Russian state, “woke” or “planted”  a laptop of Anthony Weiner’s via a virus which he placed on it through his prior hack of Formspring, and alerted Russia’s moles and agents of influence in the FBI field office in New York, who subsequently “leaked” to all and sundry that the emails had been found, and, by Rudy Giuliani’s own testimony, pressured James Comey into sending the letter he did.However, the emails were – nonetheless-  found as part of an unrelated criminal investigation into Weiner’s sexting with a 15 year old girl. The story of these “sexts” broke Sep 21st in the Daily Mail with a byline from Alana Goodman.I can exclusively report that there is ample evidence that suggests that Weiner was sexting not only with a 15 year old girl,   but, later and separately with hackers, working for Russia, including the North Carolina hacking group ‘Crackas With Attitude’, who hacked the head of the CIA, and a great many FBI agents, police officers, and other law enforcement officials.There is evidence linking Russia’s propaganda outlet Sputnik to both acts of hacking; and there is, therefore, grave reason to be concerned about Trump’s choice of Dana Boente as Jeff Sessions’ second-in-command at the Justice Department. Which he now is. For in a little-noticed Executive Order released this weekend, Trump altered the order of succession at the Justice Department in order to make Boente second to Sessions.Two of the Americans involved in Crackas With Attitude were arrested and took a guilty plea in December.And one of the prosecuting AGs on that case? Dana Boente.As I have previously reported, Jeff Sessions was placed by Trump as Attorney General, I believe, for the sole reason of protecting Trump from impeachment and prosecution in the matter of Russia’s hack on America. The placement of Boente as Sessions’ number two ought to raise yet another red flag. For Dana Boente is listed as AG on the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude case.If I am right on the theory which I report here – that Crackas With Attitude conspired with Russian moles within the FBI and NY in New York, with the encouragement of Sputnik, to use a real criminal case against Anthony Weiner in order that Russia’s Nikulin could plant Hillary Clinton’s emails on Weiner’s now “discoverable” laptop – then Messrs Trump and Bannon, above all other things, need the CWA case to go away really fast – and now its prosecutor Dana Boente finds himself number two to Jeff Sessions in Trump’s Justice Department. Thus far, the term ‘Russian hacking’ as it relates to the US elections has been understood by the mainstream media to mean two things: the hack of the DNC and Republican politicians’ emails, and the phishing attack on John Podesta, plus the subsequent release of emails obtained by those attacks through Russia’s puppet organization, Wikileaks. (To a lesser extent, the mainstream media also acknowledges that Russia backed and created a fleet of Twitter bots. They have not yet shown much sign of understanding that what is sloppily termed ‘fake news’ is in fact a coordinated Russian propaganda effort.)But the Russian hack on the United States was, it seems far more direct than that.It forced the Comey letter out of thin air. Using Weiner’s sleazebag tendencies, Russia used a real, underage victim of his sexts, to catfish Weiner into further communications actually written by an adult hacker, and thus used a real crime to commit a political hack on his computer. Then, with pliant moles in the NY FBI Field Office and NYPD, they seized his laptop. Nikulin planted Hillary’s emails upon it. Russian moles in the FBI Field Office leaked, tweeted and threatened – and even Lara Trump (from North Carolina) boasted in advance that the ‘October surprise’ was coming.From start to finish, Russia manipulated the Director of the FBI into sending his letter – which Jason Chaffetz leaked, by arrangement with the Trump camp, I believe, in order directly to swing the election to Donald Trump, Putin’s puppet.The hacker group’s name, sources say, is a pun. The letters USA in Cyrillic look like the American letters “CWA”. Be that as it may, CWA involved an underage English hacker who was arrested, and subsequent to his arrest, two of his co-conspirators in North Carolina were also arrested. Their attack on the United States was exceptionally serious. It involved obtaining emails from the then Director of the CIA and doxing hundreds of United States law enforcement and intelligence personnel.The 15 year old girl is also apparently from North Carolina, according to reports, and her father is an attorney.However, I can exclusively report that there is extensive evidence online that some “sexts” were not written by that 15 year old girl, but by members of the hacking gang.It was no use Yvgeny Nikulin planting Hillary Clinton’s emails on Weiner’s computer, or even waking Weiner’s computer, on behalf of Russian assets in the FBI New York, unless they had a right to look at Weiner’s computer. For that to happen, Anthony Weiner had to have committed a criminal offense that would enable NYPD to have probable cause to go through his computers in the first place.And for that, Nikulin used a crime against an underage victim to activate one of his own (a previously implanted virus).All of Anthony Weiner’s sleazy sexting prior to this had been done with girls and women over the age of sexual consent. The youngest among them was 17 years old. In order for a case to be created, there needed to be an underage victim – and now, contrary to my earlier theory, we know there was one. It seems evident that just such an operation was planned by Russia; to use a victim in a criminal case, to allow Weiner’s computers to be seized and for Nikulin to thereafter plant his emails via Formspring.According to the “breaking story” of September 21st, by Alana Goodman in the Daily Mail, this girl had begun to sext with Weiner in January 2016. Her original story is odd and convoluted in a number of respects.Firstly, the story is dated September 21st, but publishing dates on videos contained within the story appear to indicate that they were uploaded some six days earlier.Secondly, the story contains a report that Weiner “provided emails that he says proved he was the subject of a hoax” but the journalist does not tell us why Mr. Weiner said these emails proved this.Of course, there is the one sentence: “You got catfished by a dude.”But, I believe the 15 year old girl’s letter, as quoted, was not written by her.It is full of plagiarized quotes from novels. A second letter, ostensibly written by her to James Comey, appears to contain an odd phrase used by Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer whom Steve Bannon brought into the White House, and Michelle Bachman.The author of that letter not only claims to be a “dude” ‘catfishing’, that is to say, a hacker pretending to be a woman or girl in order to entrap, but “her” email contains the following passages:1. “My posture was consciously congruent to the back of my chair” – from the opening of Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace2. “We’re the middle children of history….” To the words “But we won’t.” – From Fight Club, Chuck Palahniuk3. “Guilt is guilt. It doesn’t go away…” to the words “paralyzing you.” – From Raise High the Roofbeams, Carpenters and Seymour an Introduction, both by J.D. Salinger4. “I was losing my soul….” To “…you still have a soul to lose.” – From Tales of Ordinary Madness, “A Dollar and Twenty Cents” by Charles Bukowski.In the letter “she” signs off “Girl that lost her faith in America”. “Lost her faith in America” turns up both in a quote from Michelle Bachmann and a Breitbart article by Julia Hahn.The above is the classic signature of a cat-fishing attempt. But there is plenty more online to connect this North Carolina teen with the Crackas With Attitude hack.Just as Nikulin planted a virus using Weiner’s little known sexting app Formspring, in this case, Weiner had been using the little-known app Confide. Online, arch references were made  in advance about the publication of Goodman’s article as to what was going on, using the word “Confide”. Other accounts with ostensibly no knowledge of the case stated plainly that Weiner was actually sexting with a 28 year old hacker.One of the North Carolina Crackas With Attitude is Justin Liverman, who is around 28. His co-conspirator is one Andrew Otto Boggs. The two were arrested and pled guilty in January. As recently as two weeks ago, the FBI had confiscated their laptops and thumb drives.Hackers need not be Russian to work on behalf of Russia. In this case, CWA’s UK and US branches had close links to Sputnik, the Russian state owned propaganda channel. A ‘journalist’ called Cassandra Fairbanks, @CassandraRules, on Twitter, who was and probably is ‘active in the hacker community’, posted photographs of herself with Liverman and said she was raising money for his defense. And why not? Weren’t CWA just some young punks that got in over their heads?The answer to that is no. The CWA hack managed to get into the emails of the director of the CIA. Executives at Sputnik pressured non-Russian staff to obtain these CIA emails and threatened them if they refused. However, it is almost certain that Sputnik already had the emails; as soon as American staff refused to release them, Wikileaks was handed them and put them out on the internet. The young boy, 15, in the UK, who had been tricked into doing a hack by and for adults, was conveniently too young to punish properly. But his fully adult co-conspirators were not. CWA’s North Carolina contingent used the same hack to dox FBI and law enforcement, mercilessly harassing American intelligence and police personnel, writing phone scripts that would ring officers on the hour through the hour through the night. Sputnik adopted Bernie Sanders and pro-Palestine colors when it wanted to defend the hackers.Meanwhile, Ms. Fairbanks was promoting every anti-American hacker, defined by the IC as Russian state hackers, known to mankind. She “loved” Guccifer 2. She fangirled over Wikileaks and the Russian asset Julian Assange. Fairbanks also pushed out co-ordinated Russian propaganda from Infowars and others during the election, including pizzagate and other Russian-organized propaganda spread by Mike Flynn and other Russian agents of influence. But with CWA she held personal meetings, photographing herself with Liverman and helping fund his defense in court.The Daily Mail, Sputnik, and TrumpThere seems to be a strong friendship between the Daily Mail’s journalist Alana Goodman, who wrote the 15 year old girl story on which the criminal case was based, and Ms. Fairbanks of Sputnik. They photographed themselves on multiple occasions together in social settings, such as sabering bottles of champagne at Trump Tower. They defended each other on Twitter. Ms. Goodman appears in many tweeted photographs by Miss Fairbanks. At one debate, Miss Goodman stars in a photograph of herself wearing a ‘Make America Great’ cap pulled down over her head. Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks points everybody to Goodman’s story on Weiner of the 21st. Goodman is also apparently close to the Trump campaign’s Moishe Lee.Sputnik’s Cassandra Fairbanks was also invited to the Inaugural Freedom Ball, which is quite an honor for a mouthpiece of the Russian state, and tweeted her pictures close to Trump and the First Lady. She followed this ostensibly unlikely triumph by spending New Year’s eve, too, with Miss Goodman (shortly after her photograph with Justin Liverman of CWA).Yet while Ms. Fairbanks promoted Ms. Goodman’s exclusive on the 15 year old girl, on Twitter, her own organ, Sputnik, and RT.com, seemed awfully reticent to promote it  – or even to touch it. Although both Russian channels covered the preceding Weiner scandal, involving the married Weiner, his young son in a photograph, and an adult woman, there was no mention whatsoever online on both Russian media channels of this story. Even though, ostensibly, it was the far more important one. Previously, all Anthony Weiner’s sexting had been done with overage women or girls over the age of consent. It was sleazy, and pathetic, certainly, and his wife, Huma Abedin, separated from him. But it was not criminal.Russia and its spies within the FBI needed it to be criminal.And yet RT and Sputnik showed an admirable, one might say inexplicable, level of restraint when confronted with the story of what appeared to be an actual crime by Weiner.There are other disturbing notes to be made about the manner of the publication of the story. While it was reported as ‘breaking news’ on September 21st by Miss Goodman, online dates on the videos embedded within the story appear to show they were shot six days earlier. Why was the story held, if indeed it was? On September 21st, Eric Lichtblau, who would later publish a substantially false story at the New York Times saying that the FBI investigating Trump’s server ‘found no clear links to Trump’, alerted Alfa Bank with a question about their involvement with the server. At that point, Trump’s server went dark. It was certainly a most opportune time to publish a major distraction that could have major consequences.Sputnik’s Miss Fairbanks also seemed to know that publication was imminent; she decided to pose in an arch t-shirt for Wikileaks that said ‘Publish or Perish’ which she said she was ‘wearing for traveling’.It is by now well-known that now disgraced General Mike Flynn, and Rudy Giuliani, once a Secretary of State contender, boasted in advance of the ‘October surprise’ that was coming based on “emails discovered” on Weiner’s laptop as part of the “separate criminal case”. The FBI Field Office in New York, indeed, have hung themselves up nicely by leaking on Russia’s behalf to these people but also by tweeting from an account. Giuliani’s partner boasted that the NYPD was also corrupt; that if Director Comey did not write to Congress, the letter that handed the election to Trump, they, the NYPD, would call a press conference announcing all the ‘arrests’ they had made in the “Weiner sexting” case.But, partly perhaps from sexism, partly from fear of attacking the first family, not enough attention has been paid to the Trump family’s own Carolina connection, and part in the conspiracy. Lara Yunaska, NC, now Lara Trump, NY, boasted on the radio, in advance, that an October surprise was coming – something she had no legal way of knowing. The FBI and NYPD are not supposed to leak information on criminal cases, particularly those ostensibly involving sexual abuse of a minor, to politicians for political purposes. Yet Mrs. Eric Trump was on the radio, bold as brass, saying on October 24 that ‘there are still a few days in October’ and ‘we’ve got a couple of things up our sleeve.’On 29th October, when the Comey letter had been leaked by Jason Chaffetz, North Carolina native Lara Trump went further, saying on the radio to ABC’s Rita Cosby that Trump had “forced” Comey’s hand with the letter.“I think my father-in-law forced their hand in this. You know, he has been the one since the beginning saying that she shouldn’t be able to run for president, and I commend him on that”Lara Trump said.These interviews followed her trip, with her husband Eric, to Gastonia, Gaston County, North Carolina. According to the Gaston County Gazette, Lara and Eric Trump visited the GOP headquarters there on October 21st.I tried to discover the identity of the real teenage girl and her father for this story (since both Ms. Goodman and Buzzfeed News claimed to have spoken to them). But I could not do so. I am glad now that I could not find out their identities."}
